The public liked their Jodi, both in reels and in real life. They did various films from 2014 to 2018, and their relationship was also going along. Things changed when suddenly Pawan did his second marriage to Jyoti Singh in 2018. The first time he married Priyanka Singh, who did suicide in 2015. His marriage with Jyoti was done overnight while in a relationship with Akshara. No one had any information about their marriage, and even Akshara was unaware of his wedding. At that time, Akshara was in Patna and didn't come in front of the media. She just put her relationship to an end and moved on. Later, she claimed that Pawan was not satisfied with the marriage. He even wanted her (Akshara) to continue their relationship even after being married. Akshara completely denied his proposal stating that her family culture and tradition have not taught her to be with a married man. Pawan then took this to his ego and told her that she would not be able to survive in the industry without him. Akshara shared an incident in an interview when she and Pawan were shooting in Silvassa for the movie Maa Tujhe Salaam in 2018, after his marriage. She stated that Pawan came out of his hotel room in a fully drunk situation; he cursed her and threatened her to be with him or face the consequences. The whole hotel staff and visitors saw this incident, and the video of the entire drama also went viral on social media platforms. Akshara also claimed that he was jealous of her popularity and views of the songs sung by her. She said he used his power and money to stop music companies from releasing her songs. According to her, Pawan tried his best to stop her from flourishing in the Bhojpuri industry, and all this was to satisfy his male ego.

She has around 4.7 million followers on Instagram and 3.65 million subscribers on her YouTube channel. She recently did an interview with superstar Mr Perfectionist Aamir Khan for the promotion of his new film Laal Singh Chadda.

Platforms User Id Instagram @singhakshara Facebook Akshara Singh Twitter @AKSHARASINGH1 YouTube Akshara Singh Vision for Bhojpuri Film Industry Akshara has always tried her best to deliver quality films and popularise the Bhojpuri Film Industry. She is discouraged by the notion of Bhojpuri films and their music being stereotyped as vulgar. She accepts that certain elements deliver offensive content because the industry's image has been dented among the audience. For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession. Although she faced hard times in her career, she stood firm when she was rejected by the directors, producers, and music companies due to rivalry and waited for her time to come.

Platforms User Id Instagram @singhakshara Facebook Akshara Singh Twitter @AKSHARASINGH1 YouTube Akshara Singh Vision for Bhojpuri Film Industry Akshara has always tried her best to deliver quality films and popularise the Bhojpuri Film Industry. She is discouraged by the notion of Bhojpuri films and their music being stereotyped as vulgar. She accepts that certain elements deliver offensive content because the industry's image has been dented among the audience. For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession.

For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession. Although she faced hard times in her career, she stood firm when she was rejected by the directors, producers, and music companies due to rivalry and waited for her time to come.

His marriage with Jyoti was done overnight while in a relationship with Akshara. No one had any information about their marriage, and even Akshara was unaware of his wedding. At that time, Akshara was in Patna and didn't come in front of the media. She just put her relationship to an end and moved on. Later, she claimed that Pawan was not satisfied with the marriage. He even wanted her (Akshara) to continue their relationship even after being married. Akshara completely denied his proposal stating that her family culture and tradition have not taught her to be with a married man. Pawan then took this to his ego and told her that she would not be able to survive in the industry without him.

The public liked their Jodi, both in reels and in real life. They did various films from 2014 to 2018, and their relationship was also going along. Things changed when suddenly Pawan did his second marriage to Jyoti Singh in 2018. The first time he married Priyanka Singh, who did suicide in 2015. His marriage with Jyoti was done overnight while in a relationship with Akshara. No one had any information about their marriage, and even Akshara was unaware of his wedding. At that time, Akshara was in Patna and didn't come in front of the media. She just put her relationship to an end and moved on. Later, she claimed that Pawan was not satisfied with the marriage. He even wanted her (Akshara) to continue their relationship even after being married. Akshara completely denied his proposal stating that her family culture and tradition have not taught her to be with a married man. Pawan then took this to his ego and told her that she would not be able to survive in the industry without him. Akshara shared an incident in an interview when she and Pawan were shooting in Silvassa for the movie Maa Tujhe Salaam in 2018, after his marriage. She stated that Pawan came out of his hotel room in a fully drunk situation; he cursed her and threatened her to be with him or face the consequences. The whole hotel staff and visitors saw this incident, and the video of the entire drama also went viral on social media platforms. Akshara also claimed that he was jealous of her popularity and views of the songs sung by her. She said he used his power and money to stop music companies from releasing her songs. According to her, Pawan tried his best to stop her from flourishing in the Bhojpuri industry, and all this was to satisfy his male ego.

She has around 4.7 million followers on Instagram and 3.65 million subscribers on her YouTube channel. She recently did an interview with superstar Mr Perfectionist Aamir Khan for the promotion of his new film Laal Singh Chadda.

Platforms User Id Instagram @singhakshara Facebook Akshara Singh Twitter @AKSHARASINGH1 YouTube Akshara Singh Vision for Bhojpuri Film Industry Akshara has always tried her best to deliver quality films and popularise the Bhojpuri Film Industry. She is discouraged by the notion of Bhojpuri films and their music being stereotyped as vulgar. She accepts that certain elements deliver offensive content because the industry's image has been dented among the audience. For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession. Although she faced hard times in her career, she stood firm when she was rejected by the directors, producers, and music companies due to rivalry and waited for her time to come.

Platforms User Id Instagram @singhakshara Facebook Akshara Singh Twitter @AKSHARASINGH1 YouTube Akshara Singh Vision for Bhojpuri Film Industry Akshara has always tried her best to deliver quality films and popularise the Bhojpuri Film Industry. She is discouraged by the notion of Bhojpuri films and their music being stereotyped as vulgar. She accepts that certain elements deliver offensive content because the industry's image has been dented among the audience. For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession.

For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession. Although she faced hard times in her career, she stood firm when she was rejected by the directors, producers, and music companies due to rivalry and waited for her time to come.

His marriage with Jyoti was done overnight while in a relationship with Akshara. No one had any information about their marriage, and even Akshara was unaware of his wedding. At that time, Akshara was in Patna and didn't come in front of the media. She just put her relationship to an end and moved on. Later, she claimed that Pawan was not satisfied with the marriage. He even wanted her (Akshara) to continue their relationship even after being married. Akshara completely denied his proposal stating that her family culture and tradition have not taught her to be with a married man. Pawan then took this to his ego and told her that she would not be able to survive in the industry without him.

The public liked their Jodi, both in reels and in real life. They did various films from 2014 to 2018, and their relationship was also going along. Things changed when suddenly Pawan did his second marriage to Jyoti Singh in 2018. The first time he married Priyanka Singh, who did suicide in 2015. His marriage with Jyoti was done overnight while in a relationship with Akshara. No one had any information about their marriage, and even Akshara was unaware of his wedding. At that time, Akshara was in Patna and didn't come in front of the media. She just put her relationship to an end and moved on. Later, she claimed that Pawan was not satisfied with the marriage. He even wanted her (Akshara) to continue their relationship even after being married. Akshara completely denied his proposal stating that her family culture and tradition have not taught her to be with a married man. Pawan then took this to his ego and told her that she would not be able to survive in the industry without him. Akshara shared an incident in an interview when she and Pawan were shooting in Silvassa for the movie Maa Tujhe Salaam in 2018, after his marriage. She stated that Pawan came out of his hotel room in a fully drunk situation; he cursed her and threatened her to be with him or face the consequences. The whole hotel staff and visitors saw this incident, and the video of the entire drama also went viral on social media platforms. Akshara also claimed that he was jealous of her popularity and views of the songs sung by her. She said he used his power and money to stop music companies from releasing her songs. According to her, Pawan tried his best to stop her from flourishing in the Bhojpuri industry, and all this was to satisfy his male ego.

She has around 4.7 million followers on Instagram and 3.65 million subscribers on her YouTube channel. She recently did an interview with superstar Mr Perfectionist Aamir Khan for the promotion of his new film Laal Singh Chadda.

Platforms User Id Instagram @singhakshara Facebook Akshara Singh Twitter @AKSHARASINGH1 YouTube Akshara Singh Vision for Bhojpuri Film Industry Akshara has always tried her best to deliver quality films and popularise the Bhojpuri Film Industry. She is discouraged by the notion of Bhojpuri films and their music being stereotyped as vulgar. She accepts that certain elements deliver offensive content because the industry's image has been dented among the audience. For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession. Although she faced hard times in her career, she stood firm when she was rejected by the directors, producers, and music companies due to rivalry and waited for her time to come.

Platforms User Id Instagram @singhakshara Facebook Akshara Singh Twitter @AKSHARASINGH1 YouTube Akshara Singh Vision for Bhojpuri Film Industry Akshara has always tried her best to deliver quality films and popularise the Bhojpuri Film Industry. She is discouraged by the notion of Bhojpuri films and their music being stereotyped as vulgar. She accepts that certain elements deliver offensive content because the industry's image has been dented among the audience. For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession.

For that, she supports and demands strict censorship norms for such content, which is necessary to safeguard the old age rich tradition of Bihar and its music. She appealed to the public to consume suitable and meaningful content and avoid vulgar music and films; then only the image of Bhojpuri music could be improved. She has always raised her voice for the support of female actors. She constantly complains about the established patriarchal mindset in the Bhojpuri film industry, where songs are written and composed with the philosophy of pleasing the male audience by picturizing actresses in sensual form with sensual lyrics of the song. She is against the culture of giving credit for the song's success only to the male singer and actor of the music. Her vision for the Bhojpuri Film Industry is to see Bhojpuri films on the stage of the National Awards, which is solely possible with clean and original Bhojpuri music and movies. Conclusion Akshara has an excellent personality. She is a girl with integrity and has love and passion for her profession. Although she faced hard times in her career, she stood firm when she was rejected by the directors, producers, and music companies due to rivalry and waited for her time to come.

His marriage with Jyoti was done overnight while in a relationship with Akshara. No one had any information about their marriage, and even Akshara was unaware of his wedding. At that time, Akshara was in Patna and didn't come in front of the media. She just put her relationship to an end and moved on. Later, she claimed that Pawan was not satisfied with the marriage. He even wanted her (Akshara) to continue their relationship even after being married.
