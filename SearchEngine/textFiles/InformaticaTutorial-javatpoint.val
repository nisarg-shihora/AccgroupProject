Informatica Tutorial Informatica can handle a large volume of data. The Informatica tool provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. In this tutorial, you will learn how Informatica performs various activities such as data profiling, data cleansing, transforming, and scheduling the workflows from source to target. What is Informatica? Informatica is introduced as a software development company in the market. It provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. It launched multiple products that mainly focused on data integration. Informatica is used to extracting required data form operation all systems and transforms the same data on its server and load it to the data warehouse. Informatica is also introduced as a data integration tool. This tool is based on the ETL architecture. It provides data integration software and services for different industries, businesses, government organizations, as well as telecommunication, health care, insurance, and financial services. It has a unique property to connect, process, and fetch the data from a different type of mixed sources. For example, we can connect with more than one server database. Here we connect to both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. And it also integrates the data into another system. Data Extraction The process of reading and extracting the data from multiple source systems into the Informatica server is called the data extraction. Informatica data can extract or read different methods such as SQL Server, Oracle, and many more. Data Transformation Data transformation is a process of converting the data into the required format. Data transformation supports the following activities, such as: Data Merging: It integrates the data from multiple sources. Data Cleansing: It cleans the data from unwanted or unnecessary information. Data Aggregation: It aggregates the data using the aggregate function such as Sum(), min(), max(), count(), etc. Data Scrubbing: It is used to derive the new data. Data Loading Data loading is used to inserting the data into a target system. There are two types of data loading, such as: Initial load or Full load: It is the first step; it adds or inserts the data into an empty target table. Delta load or Incremental load or Daily load: This step takes place after the initial load, and it is only used to load new records or changed the old records. Informatica is an easy to use ETL tool, and it has a simple visual primary interface. You drag and drop the different objects and design process flow for data extraction transformation and load. These designed process flow diagrams are called the mappings. Informatica has a property to communicate with all major data sources such as RDBMS, mainframe, Flat files, XML, SAP, VSM, and many more. Informatica Key Metrics Some main points that reflect the growth in demand for the Informatica certification, such as: 2015 income was $1.06 billion, more than the combined income of Abinitio, DataStage, SSIS, and other ETL tools. 7-year Annual CAGR is 30 percent. Partners are above 450. Major SI, ISV, OEM, and on-demand leaders. Customers are above 5,000. Customers in 82 countries and a direct presence in 28 countries. Number 1 in customer loyalty rankings from 7 years. According to all the above facts, it confirms that Informatica is in the huge demand in the world. 9.6.0 is the latest version of Informatica PowerCenter, which is available in the market. Below are the following different editions for the PowerCenter: Standard Edition Advanced Edition Premium Edition The Allianz, Fannie Mae, Samsung, ING, and U.S Air Force are the popular clients using the Informatica PowerCenter as the data integration tool. IBM DataStage, Oracle OWB, Microsoft SSIS, and Ab Initio are the competition tool for the Informatica. Here are some options for the Informatica, such as: An organization is migrating from an existing legacy system such as mainframe to a new database system. It can be used as a data cleansing tool. Integration of data from various heterogeneous systems. Why We Need Informatica? To perform some operations on the data at the backend in a data system, then we need the Informatica. To modify, cleaning up the data based on some set of rules, we need the Informatica. By using the Informatica, it is accessible to the loading of bulk data from one system to another. It provides a broad set of features such as integration of the data from multiple unstructured, semi-structured or structured systems, operations at row level on data, and scheduling operation of the data operation. It also supports the features of metadata, so it keeps preserved the information of the process and data operations.

Informatica Tutorial Informatica can handle a large volume of data. The Informatica tool provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. In this tutorial, you will learn how Informatica performs various activities such as data profiling, data cleansing, transforming, and scheduling the workflows from source to target. What is Informatica? Informatica is introduced as a software development company in the market. It provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. It launched multiple products that mainly focused on data integration. Informatica is used to extracting required data form operation all systems and transforms the same data on its server and load it to the data warehouse. Informatica is also introduced as a data integration tool. This tool is based on the ETL architecture. It provides data integration software and services for different industries, businesses, government organizations, as well as telecommunication, health care, insurance, and financial services. It has a unique property to connect, process, and fetch the data from a different type of mixed sources. For example, we can connect with more than one server database. Here we connect to both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. And it also integrates the data into another system. Data Extraction The process of reading and extracting the data from multiple source systems into the Informatica server is called the data extraction. Informatica data can extract or read different methods such as SQL Server, Oracle, and many more. Data Transformation Data transformation is a process of converting the data into the required format. Data transformation supports the following activities, such as: Data Merging: It integrates the data from multiple sources. Data Cleansing: It cleans the data from unwanted or unnecessary information. Data Aggregation: It aggregates the data using the aggregate function such as Sum(), min(), max(), count(), etc. Data Scrubbing: It is used to derive the new data. Data Loading Data loading is used to inserting the data into a target system. There are two types of data loading, such as: Initial load or Full load: It is the first step; it adds or inserts the data into an empty target table. Delta load or Incremental load or Daily load: This step takes place after the initial load, and it is only used to load new records or changed the old records. Informatica is an easy to use ETL tool, and it has a simple visual primary interface. You drag and drop the different objects and design process flow for data extraction transformation and load. These designed process flow diagrams are called the mappings. Informatica has a property to communicate with all major data sources such as RDBMS, mainframe, Flat files, XML, SAP, VSM, and many more. Informatica Key Metrics Some main points that reflect the growth in demand for the Informatica certification, such as: 2015 income was $1.06 billion, more than the combined income of Abinitio, DataStage, SSIS, and other ETL tools. 7-year Annual CAGR is 30 percent.

Informatica Tutorial Informatica can handle a large volume of data. The Informatica tool provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. In this tutorial, you will learn how Informatica performs various activities such as data profiling, data cleansing, transforming, and scheduling the workflows from source to target. What is Informatica? Informatica is introduced as a software development company in the market. It provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. It launched multiple products that mainly focused on data integration. Informatica is used to extracting required data form operation all systems and transforms the same data on its server and load it to the data warehouse. Informatica is also introduced as a data integration tool. This tool is based on the ETL architecture. It provides data integration software and services for different industries, businesses, government organizations, as well as telecommunication, health care, insurance, and financial services. It has a unique property to connect, process, and fetch the data from a different type of mixed sources. For example, we can connect with more than one server database. Here we connect to both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. And it also integrates the data into another system. Data Extraction The process of reading and extracting the data from multiple source systems into the Informatica server is called the data extraction. Informatica data can extract or read different methods such as SQL Server, Oracle, and many more. Data Transformation Data transformation is a process of converting the data into the required format. Data transformation supports the following activities, such as: Data Merging: It integrates the data from multiple sources. Data Cleansing: It cleans the data from unwanted or unnecessary information. Data Aggregation: It aggregates the data using the aggregate function such as Sum(), min(), max(), count(), etc. Data Scrubbing: It is used to derive the new data. Data Loading Data loading is used to inserting the data into a target system. There are two types of data loading, such as: Initial load or Full load: It is the first step; it adds or inserts the data into an empty target table. Delta load or Incremental load or Daily load: This step takes place after the initial load, and it is only used to load new records or changed the old records. Informatica is an easy to use ETL tool, and it has a simple visual primary interface. You drag and drop the different objects and design process flow for data extraction transformation and load. These designed process flow diagrams are called the mappings. Informatica has a property to communicate with all major data sources such as RDBMS, mainframe, Flat files, XML, SAP, VSM, and many more. Informatica Key Metrics Some main points that reflect the growth in demand for the Informatica certification, such as: 2015 income was $1.06 billion, more than the combined income of Abinitio, DataStage, SSIS, and other ETL tools. 7-year Annual CAGR is 30 percent. Partners are above 450. Major SI, ISV, OEM, and on-demand leaders. Customers are above 5,000. Customers in 82 countries and a direct presence in 28 countries. Number 1 in customer loyalty rankings from 7 years. According to all the above facts, it confirms that Informatica is in the huge demand in the world. 9.6.0 is the latest version of Informatica PowerCenter, which is available in the market. Below are the following different editions for the PowerCenter: Standard Edition Advanced Edition Premium Edition The Allianz, Fannie Mae, Samsung, ING, and U.S Air Force are the popular clients using the Informatica PowerCenter as the data integration tool. IBM DataStage, Oracle OWB, Microsoft SSIS, and Ab Initio are the competition tool for the Informatica. Here are some options for the Informatica, such as: An organization is migrating from an existing legacy system such as mainframe to a new database system. It can be used as a data cleansing tool. Integration of data from various heterogeneous systems. Why We Need Informatica? To perform some operations on the data at the backend in a data system, then we need the Informatica. To modify, cleaning up the data based on some set of rules, we need the Informatica. By using the Informatica, it is accessible to the loading of bulk data from one system to another. It provides a broad set of features such as integration of the data from multiple unstructured, semi-structured or structured systems, operations at row level on data, and scheduling operation of the data operation. It also supports the features of metadata, so it keeps preserved the information of the process and data operations. Prerequisite Before learning Informatica, you must have the basic knowledge of Data warehouse and ETL based tools. Audience Our Informatica Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.

Informatica Tutorial Informatica can handle a large volume of data. The Informatica tool provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. In this tutorial, you will learn how Informatica performs various activities such as data profiling, data cleansing, transforming, and scheduling the workflows from source to target. What is Informatica? Informatica is introduced as a software development company in the market. It provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. It launched multiple products that mainly focused on data integration. Informatica is used to extracting required data form operation all systems and transforms the same data on its server and load it to the data warehouse. Informatica is also introduced as a data integration tool. This tool is based on the ETL architecture. It provides data integration software and services for different industries, businesses, government organizations, as well as telecommunication, health care, insurance, and financial services. It has a unique property to connect, process, and fetch the data from a different type of mixed sources. For example, we can connect with more than one server database. Here we connect to both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. And it also integrates the data into another system. Data Extraction The process of reading and extracting the data from multiple source systems into the Informatica server is called the data extraction. Informatica data can extract or read different methods such as SQL Server, Oracle, and many more. Data Transformation Data transformation is a process of converting the data into the required format. Data transformation supports the following activities, such as: Data Merging: It integrates the data from multiple sources. Data Cleansing: It cleans the data from unwanted or unnecessary information. Data Aggregation: It aggregates the data using the aggregate function such as Sum(), min(), max(), count(), etc. Data Scrubbing: It is used to derive the new data. Data Loading Data loading is used to inserting the data into a target system. There are two types of data loading, such as: Initial load or Full load: It is the first step; it adds or inserts the data into an empty target table. Delta load or Incremental load or Daily load: This step takes place after the initial load, and it is only used to load new records or changed the old records. Informatica is an easy to use ETL tool, and it has a simple visual primary interface. You drag and drop the different objects and design process flow for data extraction transformation and load. These designed process flow diagrams are called the mappings. Informatica has a property to communicate with all major data sources such as RDBMS, mainframe, Flat files, XML, SAP, VSM, and many more. Informatica Key Metrics Some main points that reflect the growth in demand for the Informatica certification, such as: 2015 income was $1.06 billion, more than the combined income of Abinitio, DataStage, SSIS, and other ETL tools. 7-year Annual CAGR is 30 percent. Partners are above 450. Major SI, ISV, OEM, and on-demand leaders. Customers are above 5,000. Customers in 82 countries and a direct presence in 28 countries. Number 1 in customer loyalty rankings from 7 years. According to all the above facts, it confirms that Informatica is in the huge demand in the world. 9.6.0 is the latest version of Informatica PowerCenter, which is available in the market. Below are the following different editions for the PowerCenter: Standard Edition Advanced Edition Premium Edition The Allianz, Fannie Mae, Samsung, ING, and U.S Air Force are the popular clients using the Informatica PowerCenter as the data integration tool. IBM DataStage, Oracle OWB, Microsoft SSIS, and Ab Initio are the competition tool for the Informatica.

Informatica Tutorial Informatica can handle a large volume of data. The Informatica tool provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. In this tutorial, you will learn how Informatica performs various activities such as data profiling, data cleansing, transforming, and scheduling the workflows from source to target. What is Informatica? Informatica is introduced as a software development company in the market. It provides a complete data integration solution and data management system. It launched multiple products that mainly focused on data integration. Informatica is used to extracting required data form operation all systems and transforms the same data on its server and load it to the data warehouse. Informatica is also introduced as a data integration tool. This tool is based on the ETL architecture. It provides data integration software and services for different industries, businesses, government organizations, as well as telecommunication, health care, insurance, and financial services. It has a unique property to connect, process, and fetch the data from a different type of mixed sources. For example, we can connect with more than one server database. Here we connect to both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. And it also integrates the data into another system. Data Extraction The process of reading and extracting the data from multiple source systems into the Informatica server is called the data extraction. Informatica data can extract or read different methods such as SQL Server, Oracle, and many more. Data Transformation Data transformation is a process of converting the data into the required format. Data transformation supports the following activities, such as: Data Merging: It integrates the data from multiple sources. Data Cleansing: It cleans the data from unwanted or unnecessary information. Data Aggregation: It aggregates the data using the aggregate function such as Sum(), min(), max(), count(), etc. Data Scrubbing: It is used to derive the new data. Data Loading Data loading is used to inserting the data into a target system. There are two types of data loading, such as: Initial load or Full load: It is the first step; it adds or inserts the data into an empty target table. Delta load or Incremental load or Daily load: This step takes place after the initial load, and it is only used to load new records or changed the old records. Informatica is an easy to use ETL tool, and it has a simple visual primary interface. You drag and drop the different objects and design process flow for data extraction transformation and load. These designed process flow diagrams are called the mappings. Informatica has a property to communicate with all major data sources such as RDBMS, mainframe, Flat files, XML, SAP, VSM, and many more. Informatica Key Metrics Some main points that reflect the growth in demand for the Informatica certification, such as: 2015 income was $1.06 billion, more than the combined income of Abinitio, DataStage, SSIS, and other ETL tools. 7-year Annual CAGR is 30 percent. Partners are above 450. Major SI, ISV, OEM, and on-demand leaders. Customers are above 5,000. Customers in 82 countries and a direct presence in 28 countries.
