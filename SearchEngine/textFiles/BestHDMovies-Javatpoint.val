Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest "Dead Man's Chest" is the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, and it features some of the most impressive animations captured yet seen in a Hollywood film. What does it mean to be dead or alive? Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a character in the film, does just that. In every scene in which he appears, he is the star. Naturally, the return of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is a joy for moviegoers. However, the picture has a darker tone and is one of Disney's darkest films ever. When it comes to Jack Sparrow, he's always torn between doing what's right and doing what's easiest for him. Overall, seeing his heroic journey when confronted with the Kraken is a gem of the series.

When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself.

Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9.

Occasionally, we find ourselves browsing and scrolling for such an extended period that we give up and switch the TV off. It's still difficult to choose among all the popular TV episodes and movies, even if Netflix offers us their most-watched titles (not to mention that just because something is trendy doesn't necessarily imply that it's excellent). For your convenience, we've compiled a list of some of the top movies available on multiple streaming platforms so that you can put an end to the tedious search process. Check out our picks for the best movies to see this weekend! A list of the finest HD movies ever made is below. 1. RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) became friends and joined forces to fight for their homeland against the British empire. Ram Charan plays Raju, while N.T. Rama Rao Jr. plays Bheem. From the trailer, it's clear why the film is such a hit: it's action-packed craziness that makes your normal Marvel film appear like an Ingmar Bergman film. N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan's magnetic performances and the film's jaw-dropping action scenes all combine to make this one of the year's greatest flicks. It was one of the finest theatre experiences in 2022 for spectators because of its contagious pleasure and thrilling anti-colonial violence. You can now see it from the comfort of your home due to Netflix. RRR is a blockbuster masterpiece that must be seen to be appreciated. 2. Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest "Dead Man's Chest" is the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, and it features some of the most impressive animations captured yet seen in a Hollywood film. What does it mean to be dead or alive? Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a character in the film, does just that. In every scene in which he appears, he is the star. Naturally, the return of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is a joy for moviegoers. However, the picture has a darker tone and is one of Disney's darkest films ever. When it comes to Jack Sparrow, he's always torn between doing what's right and doing what's easiest for him. Overall, seeing his heroic journey when confronted with the Kraken is a gem of the series.

Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage.

It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3.

Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him.

Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest "Dead Man's Chest" is the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, and it features some of the most impressive animations captured yet seen in a Hollywood film. What does it mean to be dead or alive? Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a character in the film, does just that. In every scene in which he appears, he is the star. Naturally, the return of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is a joy for moviegoers. However, the picture has a darker tone and is one of Disney's darkest films ever. When it comes to Jack Sparrow, he's always torn between doing what's right and doing what's easiest for him. Overall, seeing his heroic journey when confronted with the Kraken is a gem of the series.

Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7.

Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her.

The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things.

Occasionally, we find ourselves browsing and scrolling for such an extended period that we give up and switch the TV off. It's still difficult to choose among all the popular TV episodes and movies, even if Netflix offers us their most-watched titles (not to mention that just because something is trendy doesn't necessarily imply that it's excellent). For your convenience, we've compiled a list of some of the top movies available on multiple streaming platforms so that you can put an end to the tedious search process. Check out our picks for the best movies to see this weekend! A list of the finest HD movies ever made is below. 1. RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) became friends and joined forces to fight for their homeland against the British empire. Ram Charan plays Raju, while N.T. Rama Rao Jr. plays Bheem. From the trailer, it's clear why the film is such a hit: it's action-packed craziness that makes your normal Marvel film appear like an Ingmar Bergman film. N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan's magnetic performances and the film's jaw-dropping action scenes all combine to make this one of the year's greatest flicks. It was one of the finest theatre experiences in 2022 for spectators because of its contagious pleasure and thrilling anti-colonial violence. You can now see it from the comfort of your home due to Netflix. RRR is a blockbuster masterpiece that must be seen to be appreciated. 2. Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future.

RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T.

Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest "Dead Man's Chest" is the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, and it features some of the most impressive animations captured yet seen in a Hollywood film. What does it mean to be dead or alive? Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a character in the film, does just that. In every scene in which he appears, he is the star. Naturally, the return of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is a joy for moviegoers. However, the picture has a darker tone and is one of Disney's darkest films ever. When it comes to Jack Sparrow, he's always torn between doing what's right and doing what's easiest for him. Overall, seeing his heroic journey when confronted with the Kraken is a gem of the series.

Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5.

Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year.

They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive.

After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9.

Occasionally, we find ourselves browsing and scrolling for such an extended period that we give up and switch the TV off. It's still difficult to choose among all the popular TV episodes and movies, even if Netflix offers us their most-watched titles (not to mention that just because something is trendy doesn't necessarily imply that it's excellent). For your convenience, we've compiled a list of some of the top movies available on multiple streaming platforms so that you can put an end to the tedious search process. Check out our picks for the best movies to see this weekend! A list of the finest HD movies ever made is below. 1. RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) became friends and joined forces to fight for their homeland against the British empire. Ram Charan plays Raju, while N.T. Rama Rao Jr. plays Bheem. From the trailer, it's clear why the film is such a hit: it's action-packed craziness that makes your normal Marvel film appear like an Ingmar Bergman film. N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan's magnetic performances and the film's jaw-dropping action scenes all combine to make this one of the year's greatest flicks. It was one of the finest theatre experiences in 2022 for spectators because of its contagious pleasure and thrilling anti-colonial violence. You can now see it from the comfort of your home due to Netflix. RRR is a blockbuster masterpiece that must be seen to be appreciated. 2. Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another.

"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8.

After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future.

RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T.

Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest "Dead Man's Chest" is the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, and it features some of the most impressive animations captured yet seen in a Hollywood film. What does it mean to be dead or alive? Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a character in the film, does just that. In every scene in which he appears, he is the star. Naturally, the return of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is a joy for moviegoers. However, the picture has a darker tone and is one of Disney's darkest films ever. When it comes to Jack Sparrow, he's always torn between doing what's right and doing what's easiest for him. Overall, seeing his heroic journey when confronted with the Kraken is a gem of the series.

Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5.

Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year.

They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive.

After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9.

Occasionally, we find ourselves browsing and scrolling for such an extended period that we give up and switch the TV off. It's still difficult to choose among all the popular TV episodes and movies, even if Netflix offers us their most-watched titles (not to mention that just because something is trendy doesn't necessarily imply that it's excellent). For your convenience, we've compiled a list of some of the top movies available on multiple streaming platforms so that you can put an end to the tedious search process. Check out our picks for the best movies to see this weekend! A list of the finest HD movies ever made is below. 1. RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) became friends and joined forces to fight for their homeland against the British empire. Ram Charan plays Raju, while N.T. Rama Rao Jr. plays Bheem. From the trailer, it's clear why the film is such a hit: it's action-packed craziness that makes your normal Marvel film appear like an Ingmar Bergman film. N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan's magnetic performances and the film's jaw-dropping action scenes all combine to make this one of the year's greatest flicks. It was one of the finest theatre experiences in 2022 for spectators because of its contagious pleasure and thrilling anti-colonial violence. You can now see it from the comfort of your home due to Netflix. RRR is a blockbuster masterpiece that must be seen to be appreciated. 2. Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another.

"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8.

After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future.

RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T.

Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year. In addition to Cumberbatch, the cast features Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Rachel McAdams as Dr Christine Palmer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8. Annabelle Comes Home When two nurses, Debbie and Camilla, reported that their flat had been overrun by an aggressive doll named Annabelle, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren managed to bring the doll home because of the Annabelle doll, demons attacked the Warrens on their way back home, but Father Gordon saves them and places Annabelle in their artefact room, where he blesses her to keep the evil at bay. They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive. After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest "Dead Man's Chest" is the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, and it features some of the most impressive animations captured yet seen in a Hollywood film. What does it mean to be dead or alive? Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a character in the film, does just that. In every scene in which he appears, he is the star. Naturally, the return of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is a joy for moviegoers. However, the picture has a darker tone and is one of Disney's darkest films ever. When it comes to Jack Sparrow, he's always torn between doing what's right and doing what's easiest for him. Overall, seeing his heroic journey when confronted with the Kraken is a gem of the series.

Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5.

Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another. He'll go straight into the Multiverse to take on his most formidable enemy yet: an alternative version of himself. For this sequel to the "Spider-Man" trilogy, Marvel has re-engaged Tobey Maguire, who made a triumphant comeback to the fold last year.

They are happy to see Mary Ellen again since she will be babysitting Judy overnight while the Warrens work on a case. The Warrens have given this responsibility to Mary Ellen. Shortly later, Judy is visited by the spectre of a priest at school, and he begins to become fond of her. After her father's death, Mary Ellen's friend Daniela shows up at the Warrens' door uninvited. She is fascinated by the notion of speaking with the dead. To find out how to communicate with her departed father, she starts engaging with objects that are strange and sensitive.

After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future. Judy, the Warrens' daughter, is shown here for the first time in this movie. On the other hand, Ed and Lorraine do not appear in this movie, and it has a cast of new characters. It brings back the concept of a home that is full of scary things. The incidents that are depicted in the movie happened in 1972, which is just one year after the events that were depicted in The Conjuring. 9.

Occasionally, we find ourselves browsing and scrolling for such an extended period that we give up and switch the TV off. It's still difficult to choose among all the popular TV episodes and movies, even if Netflix offers us their most-watched titles (not to mention that just because something is trendy doesn't necessarily imply that it's excellent). For your convenience, we've compiled a list of some of the top movies available on multiple streaming platforms so that you can put an end to the tedious search process. Check out our picks for the best movies to see this weekend! A list of the finest HD movies ever made is below. 1. RRR Unlike most films, RRR (2022) is a huge hit in India and the United States, yet, this isn't your typical Indian blockbuster. In the 1920s, two real-life rebels named Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) became friends and joined forces to fight for their homeland against the British empire. Ram Charan plays Raju, while N.T. Rama Rao Jr. plays Bheem. From the trailer, it's clear why the film is such a hit: it's action-packed craziness that makes your normal Marvel film appear like an Ingmar Bergman film. N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan's magnetic performances and the film's jaw-dropping action scenes all combine to make this one of the year's greatest flicks. It was one of the finest theatre experiences in 2022 for spectators because of its contagious pleasure and thrilling anti-colonial violence. You can now see it from the comfort of your home due to Netflix. RRR is a blockbuster masterpiece that must be seen to be appreciated. 2. Inception With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan won the hearts and minds of fanboys, but with 2010's Inception, he proved he was a great director. Inception is one of the best movies in the 21st century. It is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that shows Hollywood blockbusters can still be smart and make us feel something. Inception isn't just a sci-fi movie; it's also a caper movie and an avant-garde look at dreamscapes. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the main character. He is a sad widower who steals information from people's minds while sleeping as a form of corporate espionage. Cobb is very good at his job, but his biggest problem is his dreams, including appearances by his dead wife (Marion Cotillard). Inception is a no-brainer for this list. It has a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Michael Caine), amazing visual effects, and a smart, original script, which is hard to find in Hollywood. 3. Badla Badla is an official Hindi version of "The Invisible Guest," a thriller from Spain that came out in 2017. Amitabh Bachchan, among the most well-known actors in Indian film history, stars in this low-budget movie. Taapsee Pannu, gives a strong performance in support of her character, a successful businesswoman convicted of murdering the man she was having an affair with. Pannu plays Naina Sethi, and her lawyer hires a defence attorney named Badal Gupta (Bachchan). When Gupta and Naina talk about the case, Gupta says that Naina is hiding something from him. On the other hand, Naina tends to stick to her tale that everything has been set up to make it look as if she did it. The movie gets better as it goes along, but the ending is mild and funny. The two protagonists say the same thing repeatedly, which makes some sections of the movie boring. The two main actors' performances are the greatest thing about the movie. 4. Enola Holmes This year's finest surprise was Enola Holmes. As a result of Warner Bros.'s decision to sell the film early in the pandemic, it was still able to find an audience in 2020. That being said, it was a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown plays a young Holmes sister in this Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, but the writing by Jack Thorne masterfully explores issues of femininity and mother-daughter relationships, making this cute story version into a narrative with a lot of ideas about individualism and autonomy. Harry Bradbeer, the Fleabag filmmaker, keeps the viewer in Enola's perspective throughout the film. Enola Holmes offered us a huge show and a lot of emotion in a year with no major blockbusters. 5. Hunger Games Typical game shows and competition programmes test contestants' strength, stamina, knowledge, and abilities. It was similar in The Hunger Games (2012), where the contestants were tested on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. While the last candidate on most competition shows usually wins the prize, only one candidate in The Hunger Games made it to the end. Suzanne Collins wrote the books that became the foundation for the movie versions of The Hunger Games. For the film's screenplay, Collins collaborated with Gary Ross and Billy Ray. 6. Extraction Two things are going on in Extraction, and they are both incredibly attractive. One: It is a raw, savage powerhouse of an action film, with relentlessly violent violence and a one-take scene that takes you by the chest and doesn't let go. Two: It's an introspective tale about a man's struggle to rediscover his humanity in a world where being human is synonymous with death. Chris Hemsworth addresses all aspects of his character brilliantly, giving the trope-laden story uncommonly good emotional and physical stakes. When he is tasked with locating and rescuing a kidnapped youngster (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), he does it out of a sense of duty. As a result, Hemsworth is forced to battle for his life, soul, and the future of his newfound companion. Hemsworth shatters several males in this movie, without a doubt. In addition, it is also a film in which Hemsworth has done his study and, given his character's physical challenges, emotional resonance. 7. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness As a follow up to Spider-Man: No Way Home's enormous success, Marvel is doubling down on multiverse entertainment with its new Doctor Strange film. "Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" picks off right where "No Way Home" left off, continuing the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts as he tries to close the breach that caused several realities to collide with one another.

"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is one of the summer's most talked-about films. Almost all of the Marvel comics' fantasy and horror themes have been used in this picture. 8.

After exploring the whole property, she eventually finds the keys to Warren's home office artefact room and sneaks inside. Annabelle's glass case is accidentally left unlocked during her journey, and Bee Mullins' frightening spirit is unleashed soon after that. Ghosts such as the Ferryman, the Bride, demonic samurai armour, a haunted Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck are also unleashed by Annabelle. After Mary Ellen's crush, Bob, comes to see her, the Black Shuck monster attacks him and forces him to run into the backyard. The ghost of the Ferryman then goes after Mary Ellen, and Annabelle challenges Judy. Daniela is also locked up in the artefact room, where she has been tortured by a monkey toy with a ghost inside it and an old CRT TV that is said to be able to see the future.
