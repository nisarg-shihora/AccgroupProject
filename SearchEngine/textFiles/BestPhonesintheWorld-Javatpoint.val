As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging.

This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones.

The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet.

It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz.

Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture.

It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant.

Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose.

It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids.

It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10.

Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display.

It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space.

The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason.

However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging.

It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant.

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones.

Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

As per their lifetimes, it is only natural to be something you replace every 2-3 years. If you are currently scouting for a smartphone and are just tired of replacing it every now and then, you do not need to research anymore on the internet. We did the hard work for you by compiling this list consisting of the best smartphones money can buy today. All these options present in the list are top-notch options with something about their specifications and pricing. No matter which one you choose, you can rest assured that all of these will give you everything you need - future-proofing, so you do not have to upgrade when a new technology hits the market. All phones in the list support 5G; longer lifetime, so you do not need to replace your phone every 2 years and instead can go 5+ years without issues; flagship features, so no matter what job you need to get done on your phone, you can always do it without a hitch. Let us start off this list. 1. Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max Undefeated king among smartphones, and as of now, the most powerful phone money can get you. Powered by Apple's well-known powerhouse chip - the A15 Bionic, it will never let you down. As we told you earlier, every phone on this list will give you 5 to 7 years of life. So, if you choose to invest in the iPhone 13 Pro Max, rest assured that you will not need to upgrade for a long time. It has 6GB RAM along with a storage of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB depending upon the variant you choose. It comes with 3 cameras on the rear - 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The front camera is 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It has the special 6.7-inch OLED 120 Hz refresh rate display giving the smoothest experience. It has a battery life of 4352 mAh and fast charging with 27W, along with support for MagSafe and Qi magnetic wireless charging up to 15W and 7.5W, respectively. The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant. It has a quad-camera setup on the rear consisting of a wide 108MP lens (f/2.2 aperture), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2 aperture), and 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4 aperture), and a second telephoto lens with 10x zoom instead of the usual 3x (f/2.4 aperture). The front camera is 40MP with an f/2.2 aperture. It comes with Samsung's S Pen, which has almost no lag and feels incredibly smooth to use with the phone. The display is no less impressive, with 6.8 inches OLED @120 HZ. It has a big 5000 mAh battery and has support for fast 45 W charging. Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging. Apart from all features, it provides a flagship, and this device is the absolute number 1 when it comes to displaying. No other smartphone has a display as good as this, not even iPhone 13. 3. Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose. On the rear, it has a triple camera setup comprising a 50MP wide lens with an f/1.9 aperture 48MP telephoto lens with 4x zoom (f/3.5 aperture). On the front, it has a single camera with an 11.1 MP ultrawide lens with an aperture of f/2.2. It also boasts a 5000 mAh big battery life accompanied by a fast charging of 30 W. It also supports wireless charging. However, unlike most other smartphones where the charging speed is greatly compromised, it still offers a respectable 23 W charging. It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro One of the best competitors in the flagship market among androids. OnePlus is known not only for providing excellent models but for their UI as well, which provides the most demanding features not present in stock android while maintaining a simplistic and similar design. OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it.

It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price.

OnePlus 10 Pro has a 6.7-inch AMOLED @120 Hz display. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and provides 8GB /12GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB storage. Like many others in this list, the storage is non-expandable which is why all these phones offer such large storage space. However, this might be a problem for some users as this phone's storage is less than others. Don't let that fool you, though; even if you have a ton of images, videos, applications and high-memory games, it is unlikely you will run out of space. It offers a big battery of 5000 mAh and supports a whopping fast 65W charging. Even the wireless charging is 50 W! The rear camera setup includes a 48MP main lens (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 8MP 3.3x zoom telephoto lens (f/2.4), while the front has a 32MP (f/2.2) selfie camera. 5. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro Now comes the gaming phone focused absolutely on gaming performance so that you can play games without any slowdowns for longer hours and prevent heating issues. It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well, with the gamer look it has. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, currently the best among all android phones. It also boasts a massive 18GB RAM and 512GB storage space. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel @165 Hz. It also has a very big 6000 mAh battery life with 65W fast charging. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens. On the front, it has a 12MP wide lens. While in terms of being a raw powerhouse, this phone excels very well, we cannot put it high enough just because it lacks in some other features, which, while still premium level, aren't good enough as the standards set by others. 6. REDMAGIC 7 ASUS isn't the only one competing for the title of best gaming phone in the android market. REDMAGIC 7 is another one of the super-solid performing gaming phones you can find. While this area of gaming phones does not have much competition, to begin with, REDMAGIC has just as much fame as ASUS, and that is for a reason. The phone offers 12GB /16GB/18GB RAM and 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB storage space depending upon the chosen variant. Like its competitor, it also boasts a 165 Hz 6.8 inch AMOLED display. However, it falls behind the ASUS option by a little bit due to the fact that it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a 4500 mAh battery with 65W charging. The battery is very good but not what you expect from a phone which is designed for gaming, especially when most other normal phones offer 5000 mAh. The camera, however, is a different story compared to ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro. The rear has a Triple camera setup consisting of a 64MP lens (f/1.79), an 8MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 2MP (f/2.4), and the front has an 8MP camera. The cooling system present in the phone is extremely well laid. 7. SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 Leave it to SAMSUNG to surprise you with their phones. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, as the name suggests, is a smartphone with a foldable screen, and it is the first one to accomplish that without any interruption on your screen. That's right, and the screen remains seamless. The display in this phone is a 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity Flex display - as SAMSUNG likes to call it. Thanks to the folding capability, you can have a bigger screen than any other phone while still maintaining the convenience of a more standard screen. The phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB RAM with 256GB/ 512GB storage space. The camera setup on the rear comprises 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has a dual camera setup - a 10MP (f/2.2) and a 4MP (f/1.8). It has a 4400 mAh battery with a fairly fast 25W charger, which, albeit not as good as others, still gets the job done quicker than any lower-tier smartphone. 8. Apple iPhone SE (2022) Nothing could be better than getting the flagship experience of the iPhone with one of the most competitive performance capabilities for a much more affordable price. It offers a small body design with a 4.7-inch display, which at first might be a turn-off for many people, but don't judge it just yet. The phone rocks the ever-so-powerful A15 Bionic within, and its performance is superior to most others, including ones even above in the list. This is because not only does it boast the strongest mobile processor to exist but also because of its smaller screen size, which makes the chip need to handle much fewer pixels than usual, resulting in unmatched performance, which is especially noticeable when doing any CPU or GPU-intensive task. It has 4GB RAM with 3 storage options - 64GB/ 128GB/ 256GB. It has one rear camera of 12MP (f/1.8) and one selfie camera on the front of 7MP (f/2.2). It supports 20W fast charging and a non-removable 2018 mAh battery. The numbers might seem lower than android options, but that is the trend you will find in all iPhones. It is the way they optimise those together and their iOS which results in them outclassing others despite being ahead in terms of raw numerical values. 9. SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Another beast from Samsung is running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display @120 Hz. It comes with two variants - 8GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. Unlike its elder brother S22 ultra, it possesses a triple camera setup on the rear, which consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it has one 10MP wide lens (f/2.2). It offers a rather lower 3700 mAh battery life with 25W charging, which is plenty for a battery of that size. It supports PMA wireless charging with 15W. The battery life isn't the best, but it lasts for a decent amount of time, thanks to how the phone is optimised, and while the charging isn't the greatest either, it is well more than enough for the amount of battery the phone provides. Regardless, this is still a solid option to consider and possesses most of the latest features. 10. Apple iPhone 12 The fact that this phone is one generation older and still stands as one of the strongest ones available speaks a lot about its capabilities. The sole reason it is below iPhone SE is that it is older and has an A14 bionic as the SoC. Please make no mistake, it is still the flagship chip from apple, which is not going to disappoint you no matter what you do. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display. It has 4GB RAM with storage options of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. It has a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP wide lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.4), while the front also has a 12MP camera (f/2.2). It has a battery of 2815 mAh with a regular lightning port for charging, as used by all other apple phones. It also supports MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W and Qi wireless charging up to 7.5W. 11. Xiaomi 12 Pro Currently, one of the most trusted and best seller brands in the smartphone market. It offers the best-in-class 6.73-inch AMOLED display @120 Hz. It gets powered by none other than the powerhouse Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It offers 8GB/ 12GB RAM with 128GB/ 256GB storage space. It possesses a stunning triple camera setup on the rear consisting of three 50MP lenses - one wide lens (f/1.9), one telephoto lens (f/1.9), and one ultrawide lens (f/2.2). On the front, it boasts a 32MP f/2.5 wide camera. It provides one of the fastest charging speeds in phones to existing - with a 4600 mAh battery and a 120W super-fast charging. The company even claims that the phone can be fully charged in 18 mins (estimated). Even the wireless charging on this phone is up to 50W, which is faster than the wired chargers of many other phones. This is not the end of it; the phone also comes with a dual LED, dual-tone flash for better pictures. Along with all this, it possesses most of the newer features and sensors present in phones. Definitely, a phone one must look into before finalising their buy. Next TopicBest Country in the World ? prev next ?

The charging in this phone might not be the best, but other features certainly make up for it. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Samsung's current best flagship phone with sleek and premium design as well as performance. This phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 or Exynos 2200, depending upon where you live, and consists of 8/12GB of RAM with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB/ 1TB storage depending upon the variant.

Like most of the other flagships being released today, it also has support for wireless charging.

Google Pixel 6 Pro Next up, we have the almighty Google Pixel on the list of flagships. It is powered by the Google Tensor chip, which in case you don't know, is on the same level if not better than Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and has an impressive 6.71-inch LTPO AMOLED display @ 120 Hz. As of now, it is Google's best model in the market. It has RAM of 12GB and offers a storage space of 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB depending upon which variant you choose.

It also possesses excellent features for photo editing and has long-term android OS update support from Google, which makes sure that you are able to always stay on the latest version of android. 4.
