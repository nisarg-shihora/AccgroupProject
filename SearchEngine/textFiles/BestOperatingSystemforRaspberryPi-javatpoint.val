There are several OS available for the Raspberry Pi. While various Pi-compatible operating systems are Linux distributions, Chrome OS, Android, and non-Linux images are also available for the RasPi. Despite the various OS options, the Raspberry Pi OS from the Raspberry Foundation remains a top pick as one of the best Raspberry Pi distributions available. However, the Raspbian operating system has progressed significantly since its inception. In this article, you will learn about the best OS for raspberry pi. But before discussing the best operating system for the Raspberry Pi, you must know about the Raspberry Pi and its features. What is Raspberry pi Operating System? Raspberry Pi OS is a free and open-source Debian Linux-based operating system which is designed for use with Raspberry Pi devices. Additionally, many ARM-based single-board computers also run the Raspberry Pi OS. The initial version of Raspberry was released in 2013, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation began offering it as an officially sanctioned Pi distro in 2015. Raspbian was created by developers Peter Green and Mike Thompson as a side project at first. Features of the Raspberry Pi Operating System There are various features of the Raspberry Pi operating system. Some features of the raspberry pi OS are as follows: 1. User Interface It contains a desktop environment known as PIXEL, which is based on LXDE and appears similar to several popular desktops like Microsoft Windows and macOS. There is a background image on the system desktop. A top menu bar has an application menu and shortcuts to a file manager, web browser, and terminal. A Bluetooth menu, a Wi-Fi menu, volume control, and a clock are displayed at the other end of the menu bar. The desktop's look may also be modified by relocating the menu bar. 2. Package Management Packages may be installed through APT, the Recommended Software program, or the Add and Remove Software utility, which is a GUI wrapper for APT. 3. Components PCManFM is a file browser that enables easy access to all portions of the computer. In the initial Raspberry Pi OS Buster release, it was fully redesigned. Raspberry Pi OS initially utilized Epiphany as its web browser, but with the release of its redesigned desktop, it moved to Chromium. It has various basic IDEs, including Mu Editor, Thonny Python IDE, and Greenfoot. It also includes instructional applications such as Scratch and Bookshelf.
