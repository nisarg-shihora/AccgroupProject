In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}

In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}

In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}

In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}

In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}

In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}

In the first approach, a new character is added to a string to replace every previous character. This way returns the string with the new characters after all the old characters have been updated. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 The procedure returns this string if the new character cannot be located in the string. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String para = "JavatPoint is for learning purpose";
        String replace = para.replace('e', 'o');
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 2) Using Charsequence The second technique substitutes the desired string of characters for the CharSequence, which is just a collection of characters. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, char newChar)
 This operation and the first merely differ in that it substitutes a string of characters. Example: 
public class RemoveSubString
{
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        String para = "John like to learn programming";
        String replace = para.replace("learn", "teach");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 3) Replace the Substring with an empty string Java allows you to easily replace a substring you want to delete from the String with an empty String. Syntax: 
string.replace(char oldChar, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John like to learn code";
        String replace = para.replace("to learn", "");
        System.out.println(replace);
    }
}
 Output: 4) Using String's replaceFirst method This method searches for a string that matches a regular expression and, if one is found, replaces it with the given string. Behind the scenes, this function extracts the text using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods of the Pattern class. Syntax: 
string.replaceFirst(No. of digit, new digit)
 A regular expression will be created to extract a number from a string and replace it with another number as a string. Note: Only the first two digits of the string will be changed by this number; the remaining digits will remain unchanged. Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = "John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old";
        String replaceFirst = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d\\d", "20");
        System.out.println(replaceFirst);
    }
}
 Output: 5) replaceFirst() method The replaceFirst() method can be used with an empty String to delete a substring from a String. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog.entry;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString{
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 101 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parafirstreplace = para.replaceFirst("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(parafirstreplace);
    }}
 Output: 6) Using replaceAll method The replaceAll method, as contrast to replaceFirst, utilizes a regular expression to replace every instance of the string. Similar to replaceFirst, this method extracts a string using a regular expression by using the compile() and matcher() methods. It also produces a PatternSyntaxException if the regular expression is incorrect. Syntax: 
String replaceAll(No. of digit, int new number)
 We will employ a regular expression that pulls out all numbers from a string and substitutes numbers for every instance. \d: This regular expression recognizes any digit between 0 and 9. Example: 
public class RemoveSubStringFromString {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String para = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String parareplace = para.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "30");
        System.out.println(parareplace);
    }}
 Output: 7) replaceAll() method With the replaceAll() method, you can use an empty String to remove a substring from a string. Syntax: 
string.replace(No. of digit, empty char)
 Example: 
package org.arpit.java2blog;
public class RemoveSubStringFromString  {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        String replaceAll = " John is 10 years old, and Mary is 20 years old ";
        String replaceAllNumbers = replaceAll.replaceAll("\\d\\d", "");
        System.out.println(replaceAllNumbers);
    }
}
 Output: 8) Using String Builder's delete() method In order to add and remove characters from a string, the StringBuilder holds a modifiable sequence of characters. A string builder with an initial capacity of 16 characters is created by the empty StringBuilder function Object() { [native code] }, and if the internal buffer overflows, a larger string builder is created automatically. The start and end of the substring to be deleted from the string are specified as the first and second int parameters of the delete() function. The last index is exclusive since it subtracts one from the second parameter, but the start index is inclusive. Syntax: 
public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)
 When the start is negative, bigger than the string's length, or bigger than the string's end, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. There are no adjustments done when the start and end are equal. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
         StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is language or programming language");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.delete(7, 19);

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
 Output: 9) Using StringBuilder replace() Method The sole difference between the replace() function and the delete() method is the third parameter, which is used to replace the characters that have been removed from the string. If there is a large string that needs to be replaced, the size will be increased to accommodate the length of the string. Syntax: 
string.replace(int start, int end, char newChar)
 The function toString() { [native code] }() function can be used to print the updated string after this method returns a StringBuilder. Example: 
public class main{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder stringBuilder =
                new StringBuilder("Java is Code");
        StringBuilder builder = stringBuilder.replace(8, 12, "Programming language");

        System.out.println(builder.toString());
}
}
