Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel.

Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites.

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge.

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge.

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge.

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge.

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge.

Their Red Hat and Ubuntu-based developer laptops with Red Hat, factory, Canonical certification, and Dell validation install options have been an easy option for Linux followers for a while. The year 2020 was however unique for the manufacturers. The newest Developer Edition, i.e., Dell XPS 13, became the initial system in the market, along with the pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu. The computer manufacturer faced hard competition with Lenovo within the OEM Linux space for some time. Already, Lenovo had begun certifying both Red Hat and Ubuntu for their selected P laptops. The new version balanced the odds. The goal of this article is to aid us in finding a great Dell Linux laptop. The following are our top suggestions based on Linux support, user reviews, and popularity. Let's take a look. Developer's Edition 2020 (Dell XPS 13) The Dell XPS 13 has been the best of Dell Linux devices for a time. Power users and developers are searching for a great Linux laptop and prefer it over any other model. Dell raised the price a notch and released Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13. It provides a pre-installed 20.04 LTS version of Ubuntu, including many new additions like LibreOffice 6.4 and Thunderbird 68.7.0. This device blusters the 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 chip, up to 2TBGB M.2 PCle NVMe SSD compatibility, and supports up to 16GB 4267MHz LPDDR4x RAM. Also, we can select between more than one display depending on our preferences. The laptop contains a contrasting black interior and shiny platinum silver exterior that feels premium. Also, it is durable and lightweight. It has the class-leading Infinity Edge display with a touch screen aspect of Dell, in case we are wondering. The display bezels are slim, offering us much bigger screen real estate to enjoy. BIOS update is the best thing about this laptop. Natively, Ubuntu 204 LTS notifies of all BIOS updates. We will receive a popup message by the fwupd service if any update is present. Overall, this laptop is an ideal system for IT professionals, sysadmins, and developers. The best price of 989 dollars provides the best value for the money, seeing the specs of the laptop. Note: We can buy Developer's Edition 2020, i.e., Dell XPS 13, from the amazon.com and dell.com website. Dell Inspiron 15 3000 In case we are tired and sick of the two dozen configurations of XPS 13 and searching for an adorable alternative, then Inspiron 15 3000 can be a good option. The good thing is that Dell is now offering an Ubuntu edition that provides a pre-installed release of the operating system. It means making a few sacrifices in the overall performance and hardware, mainly in areas in which the RAM and CPU come into play, like every budget machine. A common Celeron processor provides power to the laptop, and its 8GB RAM would not help multitask. Ubuntu OS is still good to go with hardware (low-end) because it is very efficient around different system powers. On top of that, we can dual boot easily with a Windows operating system. Although the SSD is 128 GB merely, it is faster and the latest M.2 NVMe model. Hence, the loading and boot-up of different software are quick. The plastic frame finally combines a 1080p display, which isn't very common at this price. We also get more than one full-size USB port, HDMI, SD reader, and an Ethernet port. Inspiron 15 3000 is not very impressive to conclude. However, those wishing for a budget Dell Linux device for common everyday operations will find a good deal to appreciate. Note: We can buy Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell XPS 15 The cheapest configuration of Dell XPS 15 is the best option for regular purpose use. The expensive configurations can gear intensive tasks like programming, gaming, and video editing. It does not provide a pre-installed Linux distribution. Although, every necessary feature, such as ports, network connectivity, and sound, works with any Linux operating system. Remember that there is a minor issue of compatibility on the 9560 model, along with its GPU. The laptop is still a very reliable option with its developed Intel graphics card. For the XPS 15, two display choices are available. A Full HD non-touch screen and an Ultra HD touchscreen. Both displays have amazing full-color support. The non-touchscreen can be enough for a 10-hour period on a one-time charge. On the other hand, Ultra HD touchscreen is a lot less accommodating on power conception. The entire design is very classy. The keypad and trackpad are solid and comprehensive. The aluminium build provides a clean appearance. The blackish carbon fiber palm rest, along with a bezel-less display, covers it as a visually latest machine. The fans get intensive with the extra workload, while Dell XPS 15 is quite on lighter usage. Note: We can buy the Dell XPS 15 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5530 This laptop is a creature of a development device. If we are looking for a compact 15 inches laptop that operates great with any distribution of Linux, Dell Precision 5530 may be an ideal option. It provides an Intel Core i7-8850H Hexa-core 2.6 GHz processor, a 512 GB SSD, and 8GB RAM in terms of specs. The huge 15.6 inches display is very durable. Its 96 WH battery includes a little bit of heft, but we will like it over many hours of battery life. The trackpad and keypad remember us of the XPS. It is to say that they are great in the group. The keys are strong and with an ideal touch and travel. A similar goes with the trackpad. It is pretty slick, while it is not as bigger as a MacBook. The display is good with 1/8 of the inch bezel. There are many display real estate, which permits us to multitask and tile windows like a pro. So, if we are searching for a laptop that adds the nicest keyboard in the market, and we do not mind that it is heavy, Precision 5530 can be a good option. It is a creature of a laptop that will serve as well for a while. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5530 laptops from the amazon.com website. Dell Precision 5550 Precision 5550 is one of the modern offerings from Dell with the processing power and portability of a laptop. It is incredibly super pricey, super-fast, and thin at the same time. The display, i.e., 15.6 inches, is InfinityEdge. It means that it contains one of the thinnest bezels over the screen that we will see today in the market. The 79 key backlit keyboard contains a good feel to it along with an ample key travel. The touchpad is what we would expect through the 55XX line. We can go with hardware specifications depending on our budget. We can visit its official website of Dell for more information on the hardware front. It is interesting to remember that the USB-A port is not available on this device, while we get every latest port with the fingerprint sensor. Therefore, we may need to spend a few more for getting extra connectivity options. The base configuration of this laptop is around $2000. However, there are more affordable and faster mobile workstations within the market. But other Linux devices are not as lightweight and thin. So, we are paying a superior amount for this portability. Note: We can buy the Dell Precision 5550 laptops from the amazon.com and dell.com websites. Dell Latitude Dell Latitude is a lightweight and small laptop created with high-quality parts, and it flawlessly runs Ubuntu. The overall experience is very smooth. Whether we wish to spend lots of money on the newest hardware or bring a cheap laptop for experimenting with Ubuntu, there is a few versions of a Dell Latitude that is exactly what we are looking for. We especially recommend the laptops of the Dell Latitude 7xxx series (more on that below), but a Latitude created in the last 8 years or so will properly run Ubuntu. Dell Latitude Overview Latitude is a series of business-grade laptops by Dell. They have been forever- Dell was creating Latitudes in the '90s, but we recommend looking specifically at the 7xxx series. Dell began creating a series of laptops in 2013, along with the E7440. The Dell Latitude's number scheme tells us about the computer. The initial number (7xxx) tells us it is an ultrabook/premium laptop. The second number, i.e., x4xx, tells us it is a 14-inch laptop. Also, we will see 13-inch (73xx) and 12-inch (72xx) laptops, and they are all great (and mostly identical otherwise), select the size we like the best. The two last digits tell us the model year (hence it is only related to the year). In 2018, Dell went each way up to the E7490, then went back to 00 with the 7400 in 2019 (hence, they dropped the latter, i.e., "E"). There is a great Dell Latitude Wikipedia page in which we can see more details about the particular laptop that we might be interested in buying and what is modified from year to year. The most important modification to note is the inclusion of a USB-C port in the models of the E7x80. Why are Dell Latitude 7xxx series laptops good for Ubuntu? Intel Graphics: We can get the Latitude with Intel graphics, and we suggest doing so. Avoid AMD and Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia graphics are both an issue with Linux systems, and Intel graphics work flawlessly, i.e., embedded graphics without discrete graphics cards. The constant graphics card of Linux headaches is abandoned, and it is a better experience as we do not require the graphics card for gaming or other tasks. Official Support: Using Linux, Dell supports almost all Latitude laptops. Fresh Latitude laptops are mentioned on the Linux systems page of Dell. Moreover, several Dell Latitude laptops are mentioned as being verified with Ubuntu. Almost all Latitude models flawlessly work anyway as they share almost every hardware with other certified models, even if a model is not officially certified. Battery Life: The battery life is better significantly using Intel graphics. With Nvidia graphics, the battery is dead usually in one or two hours as the laptop always executes the graphics card. In contrast, Dell Latitude laptops offer more than 6 hours of battery life which is good enough time for a laptop. Everything Works: As far as we do not have any graphics card, we do not require to install any unique driver. The SD card reader, audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi- everything should operate on Ubuntu without any extra setup. Size: The Dell Latitude 7xxx series illustrates the ultrabook/premium line of Dell. They are only a bit larger than a MacBook Air. Hence, they are lightweight to carry, and they can fit into any bag. Ubiquitous: Latitude laptops are very basic (mostly used in business), so it is easy to get support. When we Google an issue (even on an Ubuntu system), it is possible that someone else has faced the same issue and got a solution. It is also easy to get replacement parts even if we ever need them. Quality: Latitude laptops of Dell are business-grade devices, created to last a long time. These laptops are well-built, and they are good to work with. Also, it is easy to implement common maintenance tasks and substitute certain parts, such as RAM. Value: Relatively, Latitude laptops can be cheap (specifically if we buy refurbished or used ones), and we get a good value for our money. Installing Ubuntu on Dell Latitude It is easy to install Ubuntu on a Dell Latitude laptop. We will wish to use a USB stick as our laptop probably does not have a DVD drive. We need to first make a USB stick from Linux, macOS, or Windows. After that, boot through that USB stick, and then install Ubuntu. Buyer's Guide- Selecting a perfect Dell Linux Laptop It assumes that we already know the basics of SSD, RAM, CPU, and other hardware specifications. Hence, we are concentrating on the more common aspects of selecting a Dell Linux laptop instead. Linux Compatible or Linux-Ready? The Linux-ready laptops of Dell provide an Ubuntu of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With staple support and certifications of Dell, we can ensure that these systems will operate out of the box. So, rather than wasting time fixing our operating system, we can concentrate more on establishing value for our business. That is why we suggest going with the Linux-ready systems. Linux Compatibility If a Linux-ready laptop is out of our budget, see if our preferred model is suitable for the specific release of the Linux distro we want. An easy Google search will let us know these details. Famous Linux distributions have their online compatibility resources of the hardware, such as Arch, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. If the details are not there, we can always get support from fellow Linux users. Used or New? In case we have a low budget, a slightly used or refurbished machine can save us from various drawbacks. The refurbished laptops of Dell are often in good condition, apart from small fix-ups here and there. We need to ensure that the battery is new. Next TopicGoogle Drive Ubuntu ? prev next ?
