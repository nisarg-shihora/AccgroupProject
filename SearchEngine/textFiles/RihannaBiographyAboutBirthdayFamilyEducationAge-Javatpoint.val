She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then.

She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense".

After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School. When Rihanna was 11 years old, Shontelle, a renowned Barbadian singer-songwriter, served as her drill teacher when she was an infantry student in a sub-military camp. She initially intended to finish high school but decided to focus on a musical career. Music Career 2003-2006: Beginnings and early releases Rihanna and two of her friends started a musical group in 2003. She was found by American record producer Evan Rogers while attending her parents' home in Barbados. At that period, American music producer Evan Rogers and his wife were on holiday in Barbados. His wife was called by a friend of Rihanna, who informed him of her. After being persuaded by his wife, Evan invited the trio to an audition, where Rihanna outperformed her two other performers by performing Mariah Carey's song Hero and Destiny's Child's song Emotion. Then Evan Rogers scheduled a second session, but this time she went alone, and her mother was there. He invited Rihanna to record a demo in the US after hearing it, and it was then distributed to other record labels. Rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed executive chairman of the label Def Jam, was the last person to hold this device after it passed through several other hands. Even though he had his reservations, Jay-Z was only able to get pumped up after listening to Rihanna sing Pon de Replay. So he scheduled an audition for Rihanna in New York, where he persuaded Jay-Z and L.A. Reid to want her for Def Jam. Rihanna turned down her other offers after joining the label and moved in with Evan Rogers and his wife in the US. His song Pon de Replay peaked at number five on fifteen different summer music charts in 2005, including the UK Singles Chart and also the Billboard Hot 100. She even reached the summit of the Hot Night Club Songs list. By August of the same year, Rihanna had released Music of the Sun, her debut album, earning her gold certification from the American Association of the Recording Industry for having sold over 500,000 copies. 2007-2008: Breakthrough with Good Girl Gone Bad Early in 2007, Rihanna collaborated with compatriot Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle and Jamaican band J-Status on the song "Roll It." The song was included on J-Status' sole album published in a few European nations, The Beginning. The third studio album by Rihanna, Good Girl Gone Bad, had begun production at that point. With the assistance of producers Tricky Stewart, Sean Garrett, and Timbaland, she adopted a new musical path by utilising upbeat dance compositions. After its release in May 2007, the album reached its highest position on the charts in Canada, Brazil, Ireland and the UK while peaking at #2 in Australia and the US.

Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School. When Rihanna was 11 years old, Shontelle, a renowned Barbadian singer-songwriter, served as her drill teacher when she was an infantry student in a sub-military camp.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then.

After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent.

When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then.

She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense".

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School. When Rihanna was 11 years old, Shontelle, a renowned Barbadian singer-songwriter, served as her drill teacher when she was an infantry student in a sub-military camp. She initially intended to finish high school but decided to focus on a musical career. Music Career 2003-2006: Beginnings and early releases Rihanna and two of her friends started a musical group in 2003. She was found by American record producer Evan Rogers while attending her parents' home in Barbados. At that period, American music producer Evan Rogers and his wife were on holiday in Barbados. His wife was called by a friend of Rihanna, who informed him of her. After being persuaded by his wife, Evan invited the trio to an audition, where Rihanna outperformed her two other performers by performing Mariah Carey's song Hero and Destiny's Child's song Emotion. Then Evan Rogers scheduled a second session, but this time she went alone, and her mother was there. He invited Rihanna to record a demo in the US after hearing it, and it was then distributed to other record labels. Rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed executive chairman of the label Def Jam, was the last person to hold this device after it passed through several other hands. Even though he had his reservations, Jay-Z was only able to get pumped up after listening to Rihanna sing Pon de Replay. So he scheduled an audition for Rihanna in New York, where he persuaded Jay-Z and L.A. Reid to want her for Def Jam. Rihanna turned down her other offers after joining the label and moved in with Evan Rogers and his wife in the US. His song Pon de Replay peaked at number five on fifteen different summer music charts in 2005, including the UK Singles Chart and also the Billboard Hot 100. She even reached the summit of the Hot Night Club Songs list. By August of the same year, Rihanna had released Music of the Sun, her debut album, earning her gold certification from the American Association of the Recording Industry for having sold over 500,000 copies. 2007-2008: Breakthrough with Good Girl Gone Bad Early in 2007, Rihanna collaborated with compatriot Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle and Jamaican band J-Status on the song "Roll It." The song was included on J-Status' sole album published in a few European nations, The Beginning. The third studio album by Rihanna, Good Girl Gone Bad, had begun production at that point. With the assistance of producers Tricky Stewart, Sean Garrett, and Timbaland, she adopted a new musical path by utilising upbeat dance compositions. After its release in May 2007, the album reached its highest position on the charts in Canada, Brazil, Ireland and the UK while peaking at #2 in Australia and the US.

Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School. When Rihanna was 11 years old, Shontelle, a renowned Barbadian singer-songwriter, served as her drill teacher when she was an infantry student in a sub-military camp.

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then.

After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent.

When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then.

She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense".

She is a pop and rhythm-and-blues singer from Barbados who rose to fame in the early twenty-first century and is renowned for her distinctive voice and stylish style. She was renowned for her fashion and beauty lines. American musical producer Evan Rogers, who discovered Rihanna, brought her to the country to record demo tapes. After contracting with Def Jam in 2005, she immediately shot to prominence thanks to the success of her first two album tracks, Music of the Sun as well as A Girl Like Me, which were both inspired by Caribbean music and landed in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 index. About Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in the city of Bridgetown, St. Michael, Barbados, by stockroom supervisor Ronald Fenty and accountant Monica Braithwaite. Her mom seems to be of Afro-Guyanese lineage, whereas her dad seems to be of Afro-Barbadian as well as British Isles descent. Rihanna lived the regular life of an island girl while studying at the prominent comprehensive school Combermere. In a school talent contest, Rihanna sang Mariah Carey's song, Hero, and won multiple beauty pageants. When she met producer Evan Rodgers, who was on holiday in Barbados with his native wife, thanks to the advent of a friend, her life was irrevocably changed. Rodgers set up her trip to New York so she could meet Jay-Z, the head of Def Jam Records. When he heard her sing, he had a premonition that she would be immensely popular. When she signed with Def Jam, she was 16 years old. She has experienced incredible success since then. Early Life Ronald Fenty, a warehouse manager, and accountant Monica Fenty are the parents of singer Rihanna. Her father is a Barbadian of Irish, English, Scottish, and Afro-Guyanese ancestry, and her mother is an Afro-Guyanese. Rihanna claims two brothers, Rorrey as well as Rajad Fenty, and also two half-sisters and a half-brother who all were born during her father's prior relationships with separate women. She was raised in a Bridgetown bungalow with three bedrooms and worked with her father in a street stall selling garments. Her father's intoxication, as well as hard drug consumption, had an adverse impact on her childhood and their marital problems. Rihanna attempted to mediate conflicts between her father and mother because her father had a history of physically abusing her mother. Rihanna recalls how she underwent numerous CT scans as a child for the awful migraines, saying, "The physicians even worried it was a tumour, because it was so intense". By 14, her parents had divorced, and her condition had begun to recover. She grew up listening to rap music. She worked alongside future global cricket stars Carlos Brathwaite and Chris Jordan at Charles FBM Primary as well as Combermere School.
