It was earlier called Beerkul and finds reference in Warren Hasting's letters as 'Brighton of the East (Brighton is a seaside resort located on the southern coast of England). Today, it is widely known as Alankarpur Digha. In 1923, John Frank Snaith, a businessman, persuaded Bidhan Chandra Roy ( the Chief Minister of West Bengal from 1948-1962) to transform this place into a beach resort. Since it is not very far from Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, and Kharagpur, it is a popular place for people to spend their weekends away from their monotonous lives in the cities. Digha enjoys a moderate climate throughout the year due to its location alongside the sea, but October to February is its peak time. There are numerous sites that one can relish upon visiting this beach town. Here goes the list of tourist places in Digha- 1. Marine Station/Aquarium of Zoological Survey of India It is a popular tourist attraction for Digha visitors. This is the largest aquarium in the entire nation.

New Digha Beach Digha is a relatively smaller beach situated on the coast of West Bengal. The New Digha beach is one of the most popular beaches in the city.

Lined by Casuarinas trees, the sea is at a mile's distance from the beach area. The beach is known for its alluring sunsets and sunrises.

There are also stone crumbles and boulders shaped by erosion, which dominate the beach. But it's thought to be the ideal spot to enjoy sunsets and sunrises.
