Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2.

Action sequences, high levels of energy, authentic "masala" flavour, and a sense of unresolved mystique are the first things that come to mind when we think of films from South India. There are hundreds upon thousands of films to choose from. However, which option do you go with? And what makes you so certain that it's going to be fantastic? You might spend countless hours watching dozens of trailers, reading thousands of reviews, and compiling a spreadsheet grading each movie according to how watchable it is. Or You could just read this list and then immediately begin viewing some of the most amazing movies ever made. This article will list the best South Indian movies of all time. Stay tight to your screens because if you haven't checked these movies off your list yet, you are missing out on a whole other level of enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else. 1. 777 Charlie This film is at the top of the list of the finest movies to come out of South India because of Rakshit Shetty's outstanding performance and the friendship between him and the dog. This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more. The narrative of Nedumaaran Rajangam, also known as Maara within his close circle of friends, is told in this film, which draws its inspiration from the novel "Simply Fly". He is the son of a humble school teacher and aims to empower the ordinary person to fly. In doing so, he enters one of the fields that requires the greatest amount of financial investment all around the globe. He triumphs against the many obstacles that stand in his way by focusing on his strong will, unwavering commitment, and the support of his friends and family. This uplifting film depicts the challenges faced by the average person living in a world filled with wealthy democracies. It stars some well-known actors and actresses working today, including Suriya, Paresh Rawal, Aparna Balamurali, and many more. 6. Praana This suspense film, directed by V.K. Prakash, is the kind of movie that will make you want to keep the lights on in the middle of the night. A young lady's life, played here by actress Nithya Menen, is at the core of one of the greatest movies to come out of South India. This lady decides to lead an antisocial lifestyle and moves to an ancient, deserted house far away from the commotion and noise of the city. She doesn't know what nature around her has in store for her. The plot is convoluted and will have you on edge. The genres of crime, drama, mystery, thriller, and horror are all represented in this film. 7. Bangalore Days The romantic comedy-drama film Bangalore Days was released in 2014 and was written by Anjali Menon, who also served as the film's director. Anwar Rasheed and Sophia Paul served as co-producers for the film, and they did so under the umbrellas of Anwar Rasheed Entertainments and Weekend Blockbusters. The movie has performances by Nazriya Nazim, Nivin Pauly, Dulquer Salmaan, Fahadh Faasil, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Isha Talwar, and Nitin Mukesh, among others. The story revolves around three cousins from Kerala who move to Bangalore, continuing Menon's tradition of focusing his films on families and their relationships.

Action sequences, high levels of energy, authentic "masala" flavour, and a sense of unresolved mystique are the first things that come to mind when we think of films from South India. There are hundreds upon thousands of films to choose from. However, which option do you go with? And what makes you so certain that it's going to be fantastic? You might spend countless hours watching dozens of trailers, reading thousands of reviews, and compiling a spreadsheet grading each movie according to how watchable it is. Or You could just read this list and then immediately begin viewing some of the most amazing movies ever made. This article will list the best South Indian movies of all time. Stay tight to your screens because if you haven't checked these movies off your list yet, you are missing out on a whole other level of enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else. 1. 777 Charlie This film is at the top of the list of the finest movies to come out of South India because of Rakshit Shetty's outstanding performance and the friendship between him and the dog. This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more. The narrative of Nedumaaran Rajangam, also known as Maara within his close circle of friends, is told in this film, which draws its inspiration from the novel "Simply Fly". He is the son of a humble school teacher and aims to empower the ordinary person to fly. In doing so, he enters one of the fields that requires the greatest amount of financial investment all around the globe. He triumphs against the many obstacles that stand in his way by focusing on his strong will, unwavering commitment, and the support of his friends and family. This uplifting film depicts the challenges faced by the average person living in a world filled with wealthy democracies. It stars some well-known actors and actresses working today, including Suriya, Paresh Rawal, Aparna Balamurali, and many more. 6. Praana This suspense film, directed by V.K. Prakash, is the kind of movie that will make you want to keep the lights on in the middle of the night.

She doesn't know what nature around her has in store for her. The plot is convoluted and will have you on edge. The genres of crime, drama, mystery, thriller, and horror are all represented in this film. 7.

The film's first segment focuses on a well-known figure (Balakrishna) from a small town, including his heroic deeds, love life, marriage, and struggle against the thugs in his community. The film's second segment focuses on Aghora, the twin brother of the prominent person from the first segment. When that person and his family get into difficulties, the twin brother of the prominent person comes to their rescue and protects both the prominent person and his family. Balakrishna performed, and the musical soundtrack and a few conversations that discuss the culture are the most memorable parts of the film. 9. K.G.F.

Action sequences, high levels of energy, authentic "masala" flavour, and a sense of unresolved mystique are the first things that come to mind when we think of films from South India. There are hundreds upon thousands of films to choose from. However, which option do you go with? And what makes you so certain that it's going to be fantastic? You might spend countless hours watching dozens of trailers, reading thousands of reviews, and compiling a spreadsheet grading each movie according to how watchable it is. Or You could just read this list and then immediately begin viewing some of the most amazing movies ever made. This article will list the best South Indian movies of all time. Stay tight to your screens because if you haven't checked these movies off your list yet, you are missing out on a whole other level of enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else. 1. 777 Charlie This film is at the top of the list of the finest movies to come out of South India because of Rakshit Shetty's outstanding performance and the friendship between him and the dog. This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more. The narrative of Nedumaaran Rajangam, also known as Maara within his close circle of friends, is told in this film, which draws its inspiration from the novel "Simply Fly". He is the son of a humble school teacher and aims to empower the ordinary person to fly. In doing so, he enters one of the fields that requires the greatest amount of financial investment all around the globe. He triumphs against the many obstacles that stand in his way by focusing on his strong will, unwavering commitment, and the support of his friends and family. This uplifting film depicts the challenges faced by the average person living in a world filled with wealthy democracies. It stars some well-known actors and actresses working today, including Suriya, Paresh Rawal, Aparna Balamurali, and many more. 6. Praana This suspense film, directed by V.K. Prakash, is the kind of movie that will make you want to keep the lights on in the middle of the night. A young lady's life, played here by actress Nithya Menen, is at the core of one of the greatest movies to come out of South India. This lady decides to lead an antisocial lifestyle and moves to an ancient, deserted house far away from the commotion and noise of the city. She doesn't know what nature around her has in store for her. The plot is convoluted and will have you on edge.

This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more. The narrative of Nedumaaran Rajangam, also known as Maara within his close circle of friends, is told in this film, which draws its inspiration from the novel "Simply Fly". He is the son of a humble school teacher and aims to empower the ordinary person to fly. In doing so, he enters one of the fields that requires the greatest amount of financial investment all around the globe. He triumphs against the many obstacles that stand in his way by focusing on his strong will, unwavering commitment, and the support of his friends and family. This uplifting film depicts the challenges faced by the average person living in a world filled with wealthy democracies. It stars some well-known actors and actresses working today, including Suriya, Paresh Rawal, Aparna Balamurali, and many more. 6. Praana This suspense film, directed by V.K. Prakash, is the kind of movie that will make you want to keep the lights on in the middle of the night.

She doesn't know what nature around her has in store for her. The plot is convoluted and will have you on edge.

Action sequences, high levels of energy, authentic "masala" flavour, and a sense of unresolved mystique are the first things that come to mind when we think of films from South India. There are hundreds upon thousands of films to choose from. However, which option do you go with? And what makes you so certain that it's going to be fantastic? You might spend countless hours watching dozens of trailers, reading thousands of reviews, and compiling a spreadsheet grading each movie according to how watchable it is. Or You could just read this list and then immediately begin viewing some of the most amazing movies ever made. This article will list the best South Indian movies of all time. Stay tight to your screens because if you haven't checked these movies off your list yet, you are missing out on a whole other level of enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else. 1. 777 Charlie This film is at the top of the list of the finest movies to come out of South India because of Rakshit Shetty's outstanding performance and the friendship between him and the dog. This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more. The narrative of Nedumaaran Rajangam, also known as Maara within his close circle of friends, is told in this film, which draws its inspiration from the novel "Simply Fly". He is the son of a humble school teacher and aims to empower the ordinary person to fly. In doing so, he enters one of the fields that requires the greatest amount of financial investment all around the globe. He triumphs against the many obstacles that stand in his way by focusing on his strong will, unwavering commitment, and the support of his friends and family. This uplifting film depicts the challenges faced by the average person living in a world filled with wealthy democracies. It stars some well-known actors and actresses working today, including Suriya, Paresh Rawal, Aparna Balamurali, and many more. 6. Praana This suspense film, directed by V.K. Prakash, is the kind of movie that will make you want to keep the lights on in the middle of the night. A young lady's life, played here by actress Nithya Menen, is at the core of one of the greatest movies to come out of South India. This lady decides to lead an antisocial lifestyle and moves to an ancient, deserted house far away from the commotion and noise of the city. She doesn't know what nature around her has in store for her. The plot is convoluted and will have you on edge. The genres of crime, drama, mystery, thriller, and horror are all represented in this film. 7.

The film's first segment focuses on a well-known figure (Balakrishna) from a small town, including his heroic deeds, love life, marriage, and struggle against the thugs in his community. The film's second segment focuses on Aghora, the twin brother of the prominent person from the first segment. When that person and his family get into difficulties, the twin brother of the prominent person comes to their rescue and protects both the prominent person and his family. Balakrishna performed, and the musical soundtrack and a few conversations that discuss the culture are the most memorable parts of the film. 9. K.G.F.

Action sequences, high levels of energy, authentic "masala" flavour, and a sense of unresolved mystique are the first things that come to mind when we think of films from South India. There are hundreds upon thousands of films to choose from. However, which option do you go with? And what makes you so certain that it's going to be fantastic? You might spend countless hours watching dozens of trailers, reading thousands of reviews, and compiling a spreadsheet grading each movie according to how watchable it is. Or You could just read this list and then immediately begin viewing some of the most amazing movies ever made. This article will list the best South Indian movies of all time. Stay tight to your screens because if you haven't checked these movies off your list yet, you are missing out on a whole other level of enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else. 1. 777 Charlie This film is at the top of the list of the finest movies to come out of South India because of Rakshit Shetty's outstanding performance and the friendship between him and the dog. This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more.

Action sequences, high levels of energy, authentic "masala" flavour, and a sense of unresolved mystique are the first things that come to mind when we think of films from South India. There are hundreds upon thousands of films to choose from. However, which option do you go with? And what makes you so certain that it's going to be fantastic? You might spend countless hours watching dozens of trailers, reading thousands of reviews, and compiling a spreadsheet grading each movie according to how watchable it is. Or You could just read this list and then immediately begin viewing some of the most amazing movies ever made. This article will list the best South Indian movies of all time. Stay tight to your screens because if you haven't checked these movies off your list yet, you are missing out on a whole other level of enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else. 1. 777 Charlie This film is at the top of the list of the finest movies to come out of South India because of Rakshit Shetty's outstanding performance and the friendship between him and the dog. This film is a thrilling ride through the life of a young man called Dharma, and it was directed by Kiranraj K. Dharma is trapped in a routine loaded with negativity, and he lives a barren life of companionship. He is a person who lives each day wallowing in his misery and isolation. His life is forever changed when a puppy named Charlie comes into his life one day. The youngster gains a fresh viewpoint on life from the dog, who loves him regardless of everything the boy does or says. Watching this movie, which features a variety of genres, including humour, drama, and action, is an absolute need. 2. Baahubali Characters who are bigger than life helped this historical fiction epic break records at the box office, making it the first film of its type to earn more than one thousand crores in Indian rupees (INR) all over the globe. SS Rajamouli set a new standard for visual effects by including 5,000 different shots in his movie, contributing to the film's enormous commercial success. They recruited the same special effects team that had worked on the Hollywood production of "Jurassic World." With the help of Bahubali, the kingdom of Mahishmati has been brought to life, and this is all owing to 25 artists who worked together to produce a storyboard with 15,000 drawings. In addition, the poster for this movie is the largest one ever made, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The movie was shot in Tamil and Telugu when it was initially made, but it has since been dubbed in many other languages, including Hindi, English, Malayalam, French, and Japanese, making it the first Indian film to be dubbed in those languages. 3. Jersey Jersey is a heartwarming story of a father and his kid, in addition to being an excellent sports drama. This is not a story about a hero; rather, it is about a father who doesn't want to disappoint his kid, a husband who wants to offer his wife a ray of hope, and a cricket player who wants to accomplish his coach's lifelong ambition. In the last several years, no other director has been able to build a sports movie with as much ease and conviction as Gowtham has, and the story of a late bloomer that he tells makes an impression that will not be forgotten. Jersey brings a sports star down to earth and shows how the events that strike him affect the people closest to him. Gowtham chooses to convey a narrative about atonement and self-discovery rather than a story about pride and success in his book. 4. Ratsasan A real psycho-thriller may be found in the latest movie, Ratchasan, released in 2018. This movie has set a new benchmark for the category it belongs to and has succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams in Tamil cinema. If you want to experience an exciting suspense film, you should watch it. The score of the movie is easily its most impressive element. The BGM is responsible for around 80% of the fear in the environment. The sombre score of the movie worked very well with the tone of the movie. Gibran has shown once again why he is the most talented music director. Regarding their performances, every actor gave their very best. 5. Soorarai Pottru This drama film, which Sudha Kongara directed, has been honoured with eight prizes and has been nominated for five more. The narrative of Nedumaaran Rajangam, also known as Maara within his close circle of friends, is told in this film, which draws its inspiration from the novel "Simply Fly". He is the son of a humble school teacher and aims to empower the ordinary person to fly. In doing so, he enters one of the fields that requires the greatest amount of financial investment all around the globe. He triumphs against the many obstacles that stand in his way by focusing on his strong will, unwavering commitment, and the support of his friends and family. This uplifting film depicts the challenges faced by the average person living in a world filled with wealthy democracies. It stars some well-known actors and actresses working today, including Suriya, Paresh Rawal, Aparna Balamurali, and many more. 6. Praana This suspense film, directed by V.K. Prakash, is the kind of movie that will make you want to keep the lights on in the middle of the night. A young lady's life, played here by actress Nithya Menen, is at the core of one of the greatest movies to come out of South India. This lady decides to lead an antisocial lifestyle and moves to an ancient, deserted house far away from the commotion and noise of the city. She doesn't know what nature around her has in store for her. The plot is convoluted and will have you on edge. The genres of crime, drama, mystery, thriller, and horror are all represented in this film. 7. Bangalore Days The romantic comedy-drama film Bangalore Days was released in 2014 and was written by Anjali Menon, who also served as the film's director. Anwar Rasheed and Sophia Paul served as co-producers for the film, and they did so under the umbrellas of Anwar Rasheed Entertainments and Weekend Blockbusters. The movie has performances by Nazriya Nazim, Nivin Pauly, Dulquer Salmaan, Fahadh Faasil, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Isha Talwar, and Nitin Mukesh, among others.

Anjali Menon won the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay. Parvathy Thiruvothu won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and Anjali Menon won the Filmfare Award for Best Director. 8. Akhanda After nearly ten years, veteran actor Nandamuri Balakrishna gave a spectacular performance in a film that became a massive commercial success. This film highlights the wonderful aspects of Hinduism, including its rich cultural traditions and how God will defend nature and morally upstanding humanity from the hands of those who would cause them harm. The film's first segment focuses on a well-known figure (Balakrishna) from a small town, including his heroic deeds, love life, marriage, and struggle against the thugs in his community. The film's second segment focuses on Aghora, the twin brother of the prominent person from the first segment. When that person and his family get into difficulties, the twin brother of the prominent person comes to their rescue and protects both the prominent person and his family. Balakrishna performed, and the musical soundtrack and a few conversations that discuss the culture are the most memorable parts of the film. 9. K.G.F. This crime drama film, written by Prashanth Neel and directed by him, has won twelve awards. In the first chapter of this series, the protagonist is a criminal who adopts the identity of a servant to do undercover work. In this version of the story, which takes place in the 1970s, he is intent on assassinating the owner of a renowned gold mine.
