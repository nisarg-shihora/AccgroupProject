No Does he consume Alcohol? Yes Anil's childhood time is spent in the Chembur, Mumbai, with a Punjabi Family of Film Producers. During his initial days, his family spent time in the Raj Kapoor's garage in Mumba, but later, they moved to the "chawl" area of the city. He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career. He accepted two movies subsequently: Mere Jung and Jaaanbaaz. Anil went to his girlfriend (Sunita) and proposed to her for marriage on the same night. Apart from being a good actor, he is also a talented semi-classical singer and his given voice for songs like "Pyaar Kiya Nahi Jata" and the title track for Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986 Bollywood Comedy) He got married to Sunita (The love of his life), and they are blessed with three children. His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body. As Multani Mitti dried up in an hour, he had to apply and remove the mitti frequently during the shoot. Anil is the only actor who has been part of all Race movie series: Race Race 2 Race 3 He was given the role of intelligent-cum-comical police inspector called Robert D'Costa. Slumdog Millionaire was his first international movie. He performed the character of Prem Kumar, and the movie has bagged 8 academy awards in various categories. Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie. Anil believes that eating habits and positivity are key mantras to attain a good physique and great health. Next TopicMuskan Sharma ? prev next ?

No Does he consume Alcohol? Yes Anil's childhood time is spent in the Chembur, Mumbai, with a Punjabi Family of Film Producers. During his initial days, his family spent time in the Raj Kapoor's garage in Mumba, but later, they moved to the "chawl" area of the city. He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career. He accepted two movies subsequently: Mere Jung and Jaaanbaaz. Anil went to his girlfriend (Sunita) and proposed to her for marriage on the same night. Apart from being a good actor, he is also a talented semi-classical singer and his given voice for songs like "Pyaar Kiya Nahi Jata" and the title track for Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986 Bollywood Comedy) He got married to Sunita (The love of his life), and they are blessed with three children. His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body. As Multani Mitti dried up in an hour, he had to apply and remove the mitti frequently during the shoot. Anil is the only actor who has been part of all Race movie series: Race Race 2 Race 3 He was given the role of intelligent-cum-comical police inspector called Robert D'Costa. Slumdog Millionaire was his first international movie. He performed the character of Prem Kumar, and the movie has bagged 8 academy awards in various categories. Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie. Anil believes that eating habits and positivity are key mantras to attain a good physique and great health. Next TopicMuskan Sharma ? prev next ?

He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career.

His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body.

Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie.

No Does he consume Alcohol? Yes Anil's childhood time is spent in the Chembur, Mumbai, with a Punjabi Family of Film Producers. During his initial days, his family spent time in the Raj Kapoor's garage in Mumba, but later, they moved to the "chawl" area of the city. He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career. He accepted two movies subsequently: Mere Jung and Jaaanbaaz. Anil went to his girlfriend (Sunita) and proposed to her for marriage on the same night. Apart from being a good actor, he is also a talented semi-classical singer and his given voice for songs like "Pyaar Kiya Nahi Jata" and the title track for Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986 Bollywood Comedy) He got married to Sunita (The love of his life), and they are blessed with three children. His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body. As Multani Mitti dried up in an hour, he had to apply and remove the mitti frequently during the shoot. Anil is the only actor who has been part of all Race movie series: Race Race 2 Race 3 He was given the role of intelligent-cum-comical police inspector called Robert D'Costa. Slumdog Millionaire was his first international movie. He performed the character of Prem Kumar, and the movie has bagged 8 academy awards in various categories. Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie. Anil believes that eating habits and positivity are key mantras to attain a good physique and great health. Next TopicMuskan Sharma ? prev next ?

He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career.

His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body.

Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie.

No Does he consume Alcohol? Yes Anil's childhood time is spent in the Chembur, Mumbai, with a Punjabi Family of Film Producers. During his initial days, his family spent time in the Raj Kapoor's garage in Mumba, but later, they moved to the "chawl" area of the city. He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career. He accepted two movies subsequently: Mere Jung and Jaaanbaaz. Anil went to his girlfriend (Sunita) and proposed to her for marriage on the same night. Apart from being a good actor, he is also a talented semi-classical singer and his given voice for songs like "Pyaar Kiya Nahi Jata" and the title track for Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986 Bollywood Comedy) He got married to Sunita (The love of his life), and they are blessed with three children. His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body. As Multani Mitti dried up in an hour, he had to apply and remove the mitti frequently during the shoot. Anil is the only actor who has been part of all Race movie series: Race Race 2 Race 3 He was given the role of intelligent-cum-comical police inspector called Robert D'Costa. Slumdog Millionaire was his first international movie. He performed the character of Prem Kumar, and the movie has bagged 8 academy awards in various categories. Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie. Anil believes that eating habits and positivity are key mantras to attain a good physique and great health. Next TopicMuskan Sharma ? prev next ?

He has worked in the Raj Kapoor's garage to support his family financially. He used to run and walk bare feet in his childhood. His father was a well-known producer and worked as a secretary for Shammi Kapoor. His admission into the Film Institute was rejected as he did not pass the written examination. He gave his first shot at 14 for the film "Tu Payal Mein Geet," but the movie did not hit the theatre for unavoidable reasons. His first lead role was Prem Pratap Singh in the movie "Woh Saat din". It became a common name in the household. He performed the role opposite the legendary actor Dilip Kumar in a film called It added new wings to Anil Kapoor's career.

His role in the movie "Meri Jung" proved to be a turning point for him. Initially, he was asked for the villain role but ended up in a lead role. Anil launched a "Welcome" pop album in 1986, along with Salma Agha. Anil and Salma Agha have given their voice, and Bappi Lahiri has given his music. Anil'sl signature word is "Jhakaas". For the film Mr India, Amitabh Bachchan was the preferred choice for the maker, and Anil wore the same pair of clothes throughout the movie. Anil, with his impeccable performance in the film Tezaab, set the benchmark for the film fraternity. He trained for 7 months in Gym for the Nayak movie, where he had to perform a 3D fighting scene, and the scene became immensely popular after the movie's release. He did not shave his body, and the filmmakers thought to smear the whole body with mud. His first production film was Badhaai Ho Badhaai and later My Father, Gandhi, My Wife's Murder in 2005 and much more. Anil opened in the interview that it was very difficult for him to perform a fight scene having mud on his body.

Anil, in a talk show with Preity Zinta, revealed that his first communication with Sunita had happened on the phone. He developed special bonding, and with time, they developed feelings for each other. Due to his immense contribution to the Indian Cinema, Wax Statue at Madame Tussauds in Singapore has been developed in honour of Anil Kapoor. For the movie Dil Dhadakne, Filmmaker had to spend 100 hours getting the proper designing of the Anil's hair. He was forbidden from showing his looks and had to put on a bandana to cover his head. Anil had compared his age with French bottle wine, i.e. that gets better and better with age. For the film, Mubarakan, he became a full-fledged Sardar for the first time in his career. He left his smoking habit when his daughter entered the Indian Cinema as he had promised her. After a gap of 18 years, he shared the screen with talented, gorgeous actress Madhuri Dixit in the movie Total Dhammal. Ajay Devgn was also playing a key role in the movie.
