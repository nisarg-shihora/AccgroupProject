In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4.

For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb.

Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own.

But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario.

A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home.

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6.

For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet.

It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3.

I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping. ('Men' is the subject;' napping' is the verb. ) My brother loves cold beverages. ('brother' is the subject; 'loves' is the verb. ) I read the novel. (The word "I" stands for the subject, and the word "read" is the verb. ) 2. Dependent Clauses Examples Definition of a dependent clause: Subject and verb are present in dependent clauses. They are not, however, capable of being considered independently. An independent clause is required for them to be united in a grammatically proper manner. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before going to the gym, I eat apples. I eat apples is the Independent Clause or IC in this scenario. But now, the phrase is opened with a dependent clause. Although the dependent phrase has a subject and a verb ("I go"), it cannot stand on its own as a full notion or complete thought. Example of Dependent Clause : Every evening before I go to the gym. Since this is not a comprehensive notion, it cannot be considered an English sentence. What occurs every evening before I go to the gym? This notion must be connected with an independent clause for it to be grammatically right. The independent clause is the complete opposite of a dependent or subordinate clause. It actually doesn't make any sense because it isn't a full sentence. But when combined with another independent one, it makes the sentence more comprehensive. A subordinator's job is to connect a dependent clause to an independent clause or another phrase of its kind, which completes the sentence. Conjunction, relative pronoun, or noun clause marker are examples of subordinators. Let's look at some more instances now : Whenever the kids rest. (The subordinator is "whenever," "kids" is the subject, and "rest" is the verb. ) Because my brother likes hot beverages. ( In this sentence the word 'because' is the subordinating conjunction, 'brother' is the subject, and 'likes' is the verb.) If you don't come(where "if" serves as the subordinator, "you" as the subject, and "come" as the verb) You can see from the instances above how challenging it is for a dependent type to make much sense on its own. It should be linked to an independent clause with a period to make sense. As a result, the structure of a whole sentence is as follows: Subordinate Clause + Punctuation + Main Clause = Complete Sentence OR Main Clause + Subordinate Clause = Complete Sentence Whenever the kids sleep, their professor scolds them. I got two cups of tea because my brother loves hot beverages. If you don't come, I will get frustrated. 3. Noun Clauses Examples Noun Clause Definition: A noun clause is what happens when a sentence begins to act as a noun. Look at the below mentioned sentence. Let me confirm the ingredients of the broth. ('Ingredients' is the noun in the sentence. ) This noun becomes a noun clause when a clause is used in its place. Let me confirm all that you have incorporated into the broth. Another instance is The cat can drink what she likes. What she likes is the noun for 'The cat can drink'. It is indeed a clause since it has both the things the subject(She) and the predicate (likes ) 4. Adverbial Clause Examples Adverb Clause Definition: It is a set of words that functions as an adverb and is known as an adverbial clause. For instance: He lost his fatty stomach after he gave up sweets. (The clause serves as an adverb. It may be changed to read, "Recently,") or, for instance, "I am not scared of the pen, the execution, or the swords,". I'll speak the truth whenever I want. (This clause can also be substituted with the adverb, eg. There ) Some more examples After the seminar finished, we ate dinner. Bean visits his grandmother whenever he is in the city. After the kitty arrived, she drank milk. The kitty ran until she got to the village. 5. Adjective Clause (Relative Clause) Examples A dependent phrase that functions as an adjective in the sentence is known as the adjective clause. A subject and a verb are invariably present in an adjective phrase. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. They contain a pronoun (who, that, which) or an adverb (what, where, why), or a pronoun or adverb that serves as both a subject and a verb. Here are a few instances: The boy who you observed in the shop attempted a burglary. In the mentioned statement, the adjective clause functions as an adjective. The boy is described in the adjective clause. The phrase "you observed" has both the subject and the verb. It cannot, however, be considered a whole thought on its own. Who you observed in the shop is not a complete explanation. Additional instances of adjective clauses The shop that the boy burgled is on the street. The edge of the street where my relatives live is enclosed by researchers. I know the destination where he went happily. The kitty is the one who licked the curd. 6. Conditional Clause Examples A conditional clause outlines a potential outcome and typically starts with the words "if" or "unless." For instance If it looks like storm, a basic tent can be made out of a plastic sheet. (If it looks like storm= Conditional Clause ) A basic tent that can be made out of plastic sheets is the main clause. I'll be home tonight unless the flight is significantly delayed. (Main Clause: I'll be home tonight, and Conditional Clause = unless the flight is significantly delayed ) Next TopicPhrases and Clauses ? prev next ?

In your English grammar textbook, you may have studied Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses and struggled with their subtleties. Prior to studying the complexity of parts of speech, conjunctions, and punctuation, knowing how to construct sentences is the very first and most fundamental stage in learning English grammar during the school years. What Is a Clause? Clauses are primarily a collection of words that includes both a subject and a finite verb. So, a sentence can be considered a complete clause when it includes a single subject and verb. Sometimes the subject may not be present, but the verb still needs to be distinct and unambiguous. Examples [with the clauses highlighted] I finished my diploma this year. When she arrived here, she ate vegetables. When I arrived here, she was enjoying, and then she returned home. What Is a Clause In a Sentence? A clause in grammar is, at its most basic level, a subject with a verb. The verb is the mainly the action which the subject accomplishes, and the subject is the thing that is "performing" the action of the phrase. A clause develops a full thought (an idea or a statement that can exist independently). An independent clause or the main clause is another name for a complete concept. Clause Examples Here are some of the clause examples: Subject + verb = Independent Clause or the complete thought (IC) I chew. = Main or Independent clause/thought (IC) Jessica speaks = Independent Clause (IC) A clause may also contain the verb predicate. But for it to be regarded as a clause, it must have both the subject and the verb. Here are some more clause examples ; Subject + verb (predicate). = complete thought (IC) I drink juice = Independent clause or complete thought (IC) Susan shouts aggressively. = complete thought (IC) A clause in a sentence differs from a phrase in terms that both must have a subject and a verb. This is important to keep in mind. Clauses Examples On The Basis Of Their Types 1. Independent Clauses Examples What exactly are Independent Clauses? An Independent clause can be defined as a sentence that can contain an independent clause by its own. It is the smallest syntactically precise unit of grammar and a comprehensive notion. In its most basic form, it comprises the subject and the verb. A clause may also contain a verb predicate and modifiers. (As stated in the examples above) To add interest in reading, words and modifiers can be re-arranged into clauses that are independent. Example of Independent Clauses: I eat apples at home. I eat is the subject and verb in this sentence. To make the clause clearer, an object ("apples") and a prepositional phrase ("in the home") have been included. Since the entire sentence expresses a full idea, it is an independent clause. In order to better comprehend the concept, let's look at a few examples: These men are always napping.
