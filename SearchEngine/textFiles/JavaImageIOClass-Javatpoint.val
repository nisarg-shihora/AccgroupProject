The class provides the convenience method for reading and writing image and perfuming simple encoding and decoding. The class provides a lot of utility methods related to image processing. Using the class, we can deal with the popular image extensions like, .jpg, .bmp, .gif, .png, etc. In this section, we will also discuss how to read and write an image using Java ImageIO class. Java ImageIO Class Methods Method Description createImageInputStream(Object input) Returns an ImageInputStream that will take its input from the given Object. createImageOutputStream(Object output) Returns an ImageOutputStream that will send its output to the given Object. getCacheDirectory() Returns the current value set by setCacheDirectory, or null if no explicit setting has been made. getImageReader(ImageWriter writer) Returns an ImageReadercorresponding to the given ImageWriter, if there is one, or null if the plug-in for this ImageWriter does not specify a corresponding ImageReader, or if the given ImageWriter is not registered. getImageReaders(Object input) Returns an Iterator containing all currently registered ImageReaders that claim to be able to decode the supplied Object, typically an ImageInputStream. getImageReadersByFormatName(String formatName) Returns an Iterator containing all currently registered ImageReaders that claim to be able to decode the

The class provides the convenience method for reading and writing image and perfuming simple encoding and decoding. The class provides a lot of utility methods related to image processing. Using the class, we can deal with the popular image extensions like, .jpg, .bmp, .gif, .png, etc. In this section, we will also discuss how to read and write an image using Java ImageIO class. Java ImageIO Class Methods Method Description createImageInputStream(Object input) Returns an ImageInputStream that will take its input from the given Object. createImageOutputStream(Object output) Returns an ImageOutputStream that will send its output to the given Object. getCacheDirectory() Returns the current value set by setCacheDirectory, or null if no explicit setting has been made. getImageReader(ImageWriter writer) Returns an ImageReadercorresponding to the given ImageWriter, if there is one, or null if the plug-in for this ImageWriter does not specify a corresponding ImageReader, or if the given ImageWriter is not registered. getImageReaders(Object input) Returns an Iterator containing all currently registered ImageReaders that claim to be able to decode the supplied Object, typically an ImageInputStream. getImageReadersByFormatName(String formatName) Returns an Iterator containing all currently registered ImageReaders that claim to be able to decode the

directory where cache files are to be created. setUseCache(boolean useCache) Sets a flag indicating whether a disk-based cache file should be used when creating ImageInputStreams and ImageOutputStreams. write(RenderedImage im, String formatName, File output) Writes an image using an arbitrary ImageWriter that supports the given format to a File. write(RenderedImage im, String formatName, ImageOutputStream output) Writes an image using an arbitrary ImageWriter that supports the given format to an ImageOutputStream. write(RenderedImage im, String formatName, OutputStream output) Writes an image using an arbitrary ImageWriter that supports the given format to an OutputStream. Image Read Write Example ImageIOExample.java 
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
public class ImageIOExample 
{    
public static void main(String args[])
{
BufferedImage image = null;
try 
{
//we can either use URL or File for reading image using ImageIO
File imagefile = new File("C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\image\\aa.jpg");
image = ImageIO.read(imagefile);
//ImageIO Image write Example in Java
ImageIO.write(image, "jpg", new File("C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\image\\ab.gif"));
ImageIO.write(image, "png", new File("C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\image\\ds.jpeg"));
ImageIO.write(image, "gif", new File("C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\image\\hg.png"));
ImageIO.write(image, "jpeg", new File("C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\image\\tt.png"));
}
