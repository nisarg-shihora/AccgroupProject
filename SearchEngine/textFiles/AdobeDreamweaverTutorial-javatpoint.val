Many programs do not allow this feature of viewing page in real-time on the same screen. In Adobo Dreamweaver coding and the designing view is on the same screen, on top is the designing view and on the bottom of the coding area. 5. The code of the developer is instantly checked.

For a beginner, it would be very intimidating to start the coding. 3. What you are seeing is not necessary that you will always get. This is a very disadvantage because here design view proves that it is not a browser-based view. For a developer, it becomes difficult for the positioning of items. It is 100% guaranteed that the output will be very disappointed in the browser. 4. There is no specific automatic coding option.
