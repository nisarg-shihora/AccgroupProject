Its main campus is in Middlesbrough. It has more than 21,000 students studying in the UK, according to the HESA student record for 2020/21. The Chancellor of the university is Paul Drechsler, and Vice Chancellor is Paul Croney. The national ranking 2022 of the university of 68th by Guardian, 87th by Times/Sunday Times and the university is placed in the Global rank band of 801-1000 by THE (2022). History and Development The development of the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844 was hampered for a long time by a lack of financing. The College might have opened as early as 1914 if it had received the necessary finances. Development was slow even after local shipping tycoon Joseph Constantine donated £40,000 to create the College in 1916. In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College. Constantine was established as a college for further and higher education. However, it was not yet a university. Students as early as 15 may attend Constantine. The University of London approved the degree programs listed in the College's prospectus. Metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry were among the disciplines studied. Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place. The Centuria South facility, worth £17 million, opened in 2010 for dentistry training and sports treatment. This facility will continue to offer specialised services. In 2014, the campus Heart project, a key development phase, began. Middlesbrough's campus gained a focal point with its £22 million historic structure. The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building, was also part of the package. The University announced a £300 million campus strategy in September 2017 that will alter the campus over the next decade. The University, the Tees Valley Mayor, and the Tees Valley Combined Authority announced the construction of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre in March 2021. The plant, located in Middlesbrough's Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park, will contribute to the region's continued efforts to promote renewable energy and sustainability. Academic Profile Seven National Teaching Fellowships have been awarded to Teesside University. Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor. Professor Paul Croney was appointed Vice-Chancellor in May 2015, following the retirement of Professor Graham Henderson. Research Teesside University's research is organised around five main themes. The institution provides various programs leading to MPhil, PhD, MProf, and DProf degrees in terms of research. Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor. Professor Paul Croney was appointed Vice-Chancellor in May 2015, following the retirement of Professor Graham Henderson. Research Teesside University's research is organised around five main themes. The institution provides various programs leading to MPhil, PhD, MProf, and DProf degrees in terms of research. Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

Its main campus is in Middlesbrough. It has more than 21,000 students studying in the UK, according to the HESA student record for 2020/21. The Chancellor of the university is Paul Drechsler, and Vice Chancellor is Paul Croney. The national ranking 2022 of the university of 68th by Guardian, 87th by Times/Sunday Times and the university is placed in the Global rank band of 801-1000 by THE (2022). History and Development The development of the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844 was hampered for a long time by a lack of financing. The College might have opened as early as 1914 if it had received the necessary finances. Development was slow even after local shipping tycoon Joseph Constantine donated £40,000 to create the College in 1916. In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College. Constantine was established as a college for further and higher education. However, it was not yet a university. Students as early as 15 may attend Constantine. The University of London approved the degree programs listed in the College's prospectus. Metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry were among the disciplines studied. Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place.

Its main campus is in Middlesbrough. It has more than 21,000 students studying in the UK, according to the HESA student record for 2020/21. The Chancellor of the university is Paul Drechsler, and Vice Chancellor is Paul Croney. The national ranking 2022 of the university of 68th by Guardian, 87th by Times/Sunday Times and the university is placed in the Global rank band of 801-1000 by THE (2022). History and Development The development of the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844 was hampered for a long time by a lack of financing. The College might have opened as early as 1914 if it had received the necessary finances. Development was slow even after local shipping tycoon Joseph Constantine donated £40,000 to create the College in 1916. In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College. Constantine was established as a college for further and higher education. However, it was not yet a university. Students as early as 15 may attend Constantine. The University of London approved the degree programs listed in the College's prospectus. Metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry were among the disciplines studied. Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place. The Centuria South facility, worth £17 million, opened in 2010 for dentistry training and sports treatment. This facility will continue to offer specialised services. In 2014, the campus Heart project, a key development phase, began. Middlesbrough's campus gained a focal point with its £22 million historic structure. The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building, was also part of the package. The University announced a £300 million campus strategy in September 2017 that will alter the campus over the next decade. The University, the Tees Valley Mayor, and the Tees Valley Combined Authority announced the construction of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre in March 2021. The plant, located in Middlesbrough's Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park, will contribute to the region's continued efforts to promote renewable energy and sustainability. Academic Profile Seven National Teaching Fellowships have been awarded to Teesside University. Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor. Professor Paul Croney was appointed Vice-Chancellor in May 2015, following the retirement of Professor Graham Henderson. Research Teesside University's research is organised around five main themes. The institution provides various programs leading to MPhil, PhD, MProf, and DProf degrees in terms of research. Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College. Constantine was established as a college for further and higher education. However, it was not yet a university. Students as early as 15 may attend Constantine. The University of London approved the degree programs listed in the College's prospectus. Metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry were among the disciplines studied. Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place. The Centuria South facility, worth £17 million, opened in 2010 for dentistry training and sports treatment. This facility will continue to offer specialised services. In 2014, the campus Heart project, a key development phase, began. Middlesbrough's campus gained a focal point with its £22 million historic structure. The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building, was also part of the package. The University announced a £300 million campus strategy in September 2017 that will alter the campus over the next decade. The University, the Tees Valley Mayor, and the Tees Valley Combined Authority announced the construction of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre in March 2021. The plant, located in Middlesbrough's Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park, will contribute to the region's continued efforts to promote renewable energy and sustainability. Academic Profile Seven National Teaching Fellowships have been awarded to Teesside University. Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor. Professor Paul Croney was appointed Vice-Chancellor in May 2015, following the retirement of Professor Graham Henderson. Research Teesside University's research is organised around five main themes. The institution provides various programs leading to MPhil, PhD, MProf, and DProf degrees in terms of research. Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

Its main campus is in Middlesbrough. It has more than 21,000 students studying in the UK, according to the HESA student record for 2020/21. The Chancellor of the university is Paul Drechsler, and Vice Chancellor is Paul Croney. The national ranking 2022 of the university of 68th by Guardian, 87th by Times/Sunday Times and the university is placed in the Global rank band of 801-1000 by THE (2022). History and Development The development of the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844 was hampered for a long time by a lack of financing. The College might have opened as early as 1914 if it had received the necessary finances. Development was slow even after local shipping tycoon Joseph Constantine donated £40,000 to create the College in 1916. In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College. Constantine was established as a college for further and higher education. However, it was not yet a university. Students as early as 15 may attend Constantine. The University of London approved the degree programs listed in the College's prospectus. Metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry were among the disciplines studied. Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place. The Centuria South facility, worth £17 million, opened in 2010 for dentistry training and sports treatment. This facility will continue to offer specialised services. In 2014, the campus Heart project, a key development phase, began. Middlesbrough's campus gained a focal point with its £22 million historic structure. The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building, was also part of the package. The University announced a £300 million campus strategy in September 2017 that will alter the campus over the next decade. The University, the Tees Valley Mayor, and the Tees Valley Combined Authority announced the construction of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre in March 2021. The plant, located in Middlesbrough's Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park, will contribute to the region's continued efforts to promote renewable energy and sustainability. Academic Profile Seven National Teaching Fellowships have been awarded to Teesside University. Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor.

Its main campus is in Middlesbrough. It has more than 21,000 students studying in the UK, according to the HESA student record for 2020/21. The Chancellor of the university is Paul Drechsler, and Vice Chancellor is Paul Croney. The national ranking 2022 of the university of 68th by Guardian, 87th by Times/Sunday Times and the university is placed in the Global rank band of 801-1000 by THE (2022). History and Development The development of the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844 was hampered for a long time by a lack of financing. The College might have opened as early as 1914 if it had received the necessary finances. Development was slow even after local shipping tycoon Joseph Constantine donated £40,000 to create the College in 1916. In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College. Constantine was established as a college for further and higher education. However, it was not yet a university. Students as early as 15 may attend Constantine. The University of London approved the degree programs listed in the College's prospectus. Metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry were among the disciplines studied. Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place. The Centuria South facility, worth £17 million, opened in 2010 for dentistry training and sports treatment. This facility will continue to offer specialised services. In 2014, the campus Heart project, a key development phase, began. Middlesbrough's campus gained a focal point with its £22 million historic structure. The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building, was also part of the package. The University announced a £300 million campus strategy in September 2017 that will alter the campus over the next decade. The University, the Tees Valley Mayor, and the Tees Valley Combined Authority announced the construction of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre in March 2021. The plant, located in Middlesbrough's Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park, will contribute to the region's continued efforts to promote renewable energy and sustainability. Academic Profile Seven National Teaching Fellowships have been awarded to Teesside University. Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor. Professor Paul Croney was appointed Vice-Chancellor in May 2015, following the retirement of Professor Graham Henderson. Research Teesside University's research is organised around five main themes. The institution provides various programs leading to MPhil, PhD, MProf, and DProf degrees in terms of research. Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

Five rooms were also set aside for an art department until the School of Art was forced to separate from its parent location in the 1950s due to space constraints. The 1960s were a period of significant change and political sting for the still-developing College. The first two "Teesside University" campaigns, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second from 1967 to 1972, both began before the decade's end. At both times, Anthony Crosland's scepticism and Margaret Thatcher's defining White Paper put an end to sprinklings of enthusiasm. Until at least the 1980s, the latter effectively put any ambitions for new institutions in the United Kingdom. The addition of an 11-story "skyscraper" to the College's campus in 1963 was one of the most noticeable major advancements on campus. The adjacent former High School, built-in 1877, was also acquired by the College. The University offered seventeen-degree programs at the time. Before becoming Teesside Polytechnic in 1969, the College was briefly known as Constantine College of Technology. In the 1970s, the school merged with Teesside College of Education and purchased Flatts Lane. In 1973, the Clarendon Building was completed, followed by the Stephenson Building in 1976. These structures were used during the Polytechnic's long-awaited transformation into a university. The College had about 8,000 students by the 1990s. The former Polytechnic library was decommissioned in 1997, and a Learning Resource Centre was established in its place. The Centuria South facility, worth £17 million, opened in 2010 for dentistry training and sports treatment. This facility will continue to offer specialised services. In 2014, the campus Heart project, a key development phase, began. Middlesbrough's campus gained a focal point with its £22 million historic structure. The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building, was also part of the package. The University announced a £300 million campus strategy in September 2017 that will alter the campus over the next decade. The University, the Tees Valley Mayor, and the Tees Valley Combined Authority announced the construction of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre in March 2021. The plant, located in Middlesbrough's Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park, will contribute to the region's continued efforts to promote renewable energy and sustainability. Academic Profile Seven National Teaching Fellowships have been awarded to Teesside University. Lord Sawyer became the University's Chancellor in April 2005, succeeding European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the University's first-ever Chancellor. Professor Paul Croney was appointed Vice-Chancellor in May 2015, following the retirement of Professor Graham Henderson. Research Teesside University's research is organised around five main themes. The institution provides various programs leading to MPhil, PhD, MProf, and DProf degrees in terms of research. Campuses Since its foundation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 on the south banks of the River Tees in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England, Teesside University has been known as Teesside University. The Waterhouse clock tower stands in front of the University's main entrance, located on the ancient Constantine College building site. The A19 and A66 highways provide transportation connections. The University's first Darlington campus was established at the former Eastbourne Secondary School in Darlington's Eastbourne neighbourhood. Darlington's new £13 million Central Park campus opened in 2011. Campus Heart is the most recent investment phase in the Middlesbrough campus, with a total expenditure of £30 million. The Curve, a £20 million structure with a 200-seat lecture theatre and 1,476 square meters of teaching and learning space, was completed in 2014. It is located within a pedestrianised and manicured area that serves as the campus's focal point. The repair and addition of the University's Orion Building, a three-story glass extension to accommodate new, industry-standard equipment, cost £6 million in 2015. In August 2015, it was reported that an additional £2.5 million would be invested in the award-winning Students' Union and a £2 million investment in campus culinary facilities. A £5 million investment is also anticipated for the library. In January 2016, Teesside University's Middlesbrough campus welcomed a £2.5 million health and fitness centre. Between 2017 and 2027, the University will invest £300 million in its campus. Accommodation Self-catered rooms are available at Teesside University, but they are usually designated for first-year undergraduate students. International students, postgraduates, staff, and undergraduates can all stay on campus. The University manages several residences (halls, houses, and flats). Additional accommodation options are available through the university-managed housing program. Teesside Central, which added 75 en-suite apartments to the University's accommodation inventory, was purchased in 2015. Central Halls is the name for this type of lodging. Student's Union The student body elects three current students to serve as President of Education, President of Activities, and President of Welfare in March of each year. They serve for one year, from July to June, with the option of running for a second and final term. A larger board of trustees controls the Students' Union's operations and includes external trustees from local government, businesses, charities, and the public sector.

Its main campus is in Middlesbrough. It has more than 21,000 students studying in the UK, according to the HESA student record for 2020/21. The Chancellor of the university is Paul Drechsler, and Vice Chancellor is Paul Croney. The national ranking 2022 of the university of 68th by Guardian, 87th by Times/Sunday Times and the university is placed in the Global rank band of 801-1000 by THE (2022). History and Development The development of the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics' Institute of 1844 was hampered for a long time by a lack of financing. The College might have opened as early as 1914 if it had received the necessary finances. Development was slow even after local shipping tycoon Joseph Constantine donated £40,000 to create the College in 1916. In 1922, a Governing Council was convened, followed by the Constantine family's doubling of the original financial offer in 1924. Graham R. Dawbarn was appointed on March 29, 1926, to construct the first technical college building. Construction began in 1927 and ended on September 16, 1929, with the first day of enrolment and instruction. On July 2, 1930, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, formally opened Constantine Technical College.
