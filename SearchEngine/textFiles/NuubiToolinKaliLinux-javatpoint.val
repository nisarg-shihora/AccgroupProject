One tool used for penetration testing is NUUBI. NUUBI is a Python-based tool that conducts a large amount of recon. Nuubi Gathers Information Like: The following is the list of information that nubbi can generate: Performing Banner grabbing Performing Cms detection Performing Subnetlookup Perform DNS lookup Performing GeoIP lookup Performing HTTP headers Performing Nmap scan Performing Extract links Recon Performing Traceroute Scan Performing Subdomain lookup Performing Traceroute Scan URL and website scanner for potentially malicious websites, etc. Performing Certificate transparency log monitor Finding hosts sharing DNS servers Gathering this information can make exploitation easier and give the penetration tester a better framework for performing security research. Installation of Nuubi Tool in Kali Linux Step 1: In order to install Nuubi, first, we have to open our Kali Linux terminal and then move to the Desktop with the help of the command below: 
Cd Dektop
 Step 2: Now that we are on the Dektop, use the following command to create a new directory called NUUBI. The installation of the NUUBI tool will be completed in this directory. 
Mkdir NUUBI
 Step 3: Next, with the help of the following command, we have to switch to NUUBI 
Cd NUUBI
 Step 4: Next, we have to install the tool. The tool must be cloned from Github. 
Git clone https://github.com/pikpikcu/nubbi.git
 Step 5: The tool has been successfully downloaded to the NUUBI directory. Using the following command, list the content of the tool. 
Ls
 Step 6: We can see that a new directory for the nubbi tools was created while we were installing it. Now use the following command to get to that directory. 
cd nubbi
 Step 7: Use the command below to discover the contents of the tool once more. 
Ls
 Step 8: Next, we have to download the required packages for running the tool. For this, we need to use the command below. 
Pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 Step 9: Now that we've completed our installation, use the command below to view the help (which provides a better knowledge of the tool). 
Python3 nuub,py -h
 Example 1: Subnet Lookup of Target In this example, we'll collect information on the javatpoint.com subnet lookup. Subnet lookup yielded the following results: Address, Netmask, Network Range, Broadcast, etc. 
Python3 nuub.py -s javatpoint.com
 Example 2: Subdomain Lookup of the target domain In this case, we're gathering the target's subdomain. The -S tag, followed by the target URL (javatpoint.com) for this collection. 
Python3 nuub.py -S javatpoint.com
 Example 3: HTTP Headers of target URL We'll be intercepting the HTTP Headers for our target in this example. We have a status code, a Server, a Location, and a Connection. 
Python3 nuub.py -H javatpoint.com
 Example 4: Reverse DNS from the target IP address In this example, we'll use Reverse DNS to resolve an IP address. As we can see, we submitted our target's IP address and obtained the DNS Name for the related IP address. 
Python3 nuub.py -revdns 34.218.62.116
 Example 5: CMS Detection of Target We'll be gathering CMS (Content Management System) information in this example. In the Results, we have got the server details and more information. 
Python3 nuub.py -c javatpoint.com
 Example 6: Find hosts sharing DNS servers In this case, we will gather the host which is sharing the same DNS Server as javatpoint.com. As we can see, we have No DNS Server Record as a consequence, which suggests that javatpoint.com does not share its DNS Server with other hosts. 
Python3 nuub.py -f javatpoint.com
 Example 7: Crawler target URL In this example, we'll crawl the target's metadata, which may contain important information. 
Python3 nuub.py -C javatpoint.com
 We've crawled some significant URLs from javatpoint.com in the screenshot below. Example 8: Certificate Transparency log Monitor In this gathering, we will be gathering Certificate Transparency logs from our target domain in this case.
