It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l1 = getData();
        l1.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;
        }

        return l1;

public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallellys.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    
    r2Parallel.forEach(System.out::println);

}

 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.

 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes

{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}

Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.

 Java Program to Check Stream is Running Parallel or Not We can also check whether the stream is running in parallel or not. FileName: ParallelStream3.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream3 
{

// main method
public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l1 = getData();
        l1.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;
        }

        return l1;

public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallellys.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    
    r2Parallel.forEach(System.out::println);

}

 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.

 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes

{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}

Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.

 Java Program to Check Stream is Running Parallel or Not We can also check whether the stream is running in parallel or not. FileName: ParallelStream3.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream3 
{

// main method
public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l1 = getData();
        l1.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;
        }

        return l1;

public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallellys.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    
    r2Parallel.forEach(System.out::println);

}

 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.

 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes

{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}

Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.

 Java Program to Check Stream is Running Parallel or Not We can also check whether the stream is running in parallel or not. FileName: ParallelStream3.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream3 
{

// main method
public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;

It is meant for utilizing the various cores of the processor. Usually, any Java code that has only one processing stream, where it is sequentially executed. However, by using parallel streams, one can separate the Java code into more than one stream, which is executed in parallel on their separate cores, and the end result is the combination of the individual results. The order in which they are executed is not in our control. Hence, it is suggested to use a parallel stream when the order of execution of individual items does not affect the final result. Analysis of Parallel Stream For increasing the performance of a program, parallel streams are introduced. However, it is not a guarantee that applying a parallel stream will enhance the result. For example, there can be a scenario where code must be executed in a certain order. There are certain instances in which we need the code to be executed in a certain order, and in such a case, it is required to use sequential streams instead of parallel streams. Different Ways to Create Stream There are two ways we can create, which are listed below and described later as follows: Using the parallel() method on a stream Using parallelStream() on a Collection Using parallel() method on a stream The parallel() method of the BaseStream interface returns an equivalent parallel stream. Let's understand its working through an example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// A Stream of the string type using the method line() is created
// for reading only one link at a time from the mentioned text file
Stream<String> txt = Files.lines(f.toPath());

// Creating the parallel streams using the parallel() method
// and later using the forEach() in order to print on the console
txt.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

// the Stream is closed by invoking the close() method
txt.close();
}
}
 Output 1: Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above program, we have made a file object that points to a parallelstream.txt file that is already present in the system. After that, a stream is created that does reading from the text file (only one line at a time). Then we invoke the parallel() method to display the content of the parallelstream.txt on the console. Note that the order of the execution is different each time we execute the above code. The code is executed again; the following output is displayed on the console. Output 2: Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

        List<String> l1 = getData();
        l1.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;
        }

        return l1;

public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallellys.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    
    r2Parallel.forEach(System.out::println);

}

 Using parallelStream() on a Collection The parallelStream() method is part of the Collection interface and returns a parallel stream with the collection as a source. It's working of it is explained in the following example. FileName: ParallelStream.java 
// Importing the required classes
import java.util.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;


// Main class
public class ParallelStream
{

// Main method
public static void main(String[] argvs) throws IOException 
{

// Creating a File object
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Nikhil\\Downloads\\ParallelStreams\\parallelstream.txt");

// Reading the lines of the file parallelstream.txt by
// making a List by invoking the method readAllLines()
List<String> text = Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());

// Creating different parallel streams by making a List
// by invoking the method readAllLines()
text.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
}
}
 Output 1: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Sed ut ipsum molestie dolor dictum luctus.
Vestibulum urna lacus, eleifend venenatis ipsum at, venenatis fringilla mauris.
Maecenas interdum erat feugiat rhoncus mattis. Phasellus facilisis ex non magna faucibus mollis.
Fusce nulla augue, convallis at velit ac, pulvinar convallis eros.
Vestibulum eu tellus nec lectus rutrum ornare ac tincidunt sem.
 Explanation: In the above-mentioned code, we are using a parallel stream. However, we are using the List to read from the parallelstream.txt file. Hence, the parallelstream() method is required. Other Examples of Parallel Execution of Stream Let's see a few more examples of parallel execution of streams. FileName: ParallelStream1.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream1 
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");
      
        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
		IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r.forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        // prints values from 1 to 5 (1 and 5 included)
        IntStream r1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
        r1.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

    }

}
 Output: In Normal

 Let's see another example. FileName: ParallelStream2.java 
// important import statements
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;


public class ParallelStream2
{

    // main method
    public static void main(String[] argvs) 
    {

        System.out.println("In Normal");

        List<String> l1 = getData();
        l1.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("In Parallel");

        List<String> l2 = getData();
        l2.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
        
    }

    private static List<String> getData()
    {

        List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();

        // for 'a' value is 97
        // for 'b' value is 98 and so on
        int alphabets = 97;  
        while (alphabets <= 106) 
        {
            char ch = (char)alphabets;
            l1.add(String.valueOf(ch));
            alphabets = alphabets + 1;
        }

        return l1;

    }

}
 Output: In Normal

 Java Program to Check Stream is Running Parallel or Not We can also check whether the stream is running in parallel or not. FileName: ParallelStream3.java 
// important import statement
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStream3 
{

// main method
public static void main(String[] args) 
{

    System.out.println("In Normal");

    IntStream r = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    
    // it will give a false value
    if(r.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallelly.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    r.forEach(System.out::println);

    System.out.println("In Parallel");

    IntStream r2 = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5);
    IntStream r2Parallel = r2.parallel();
    
    // it will give a true value
    if(r2.isParallel())
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is running parallellys.");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("The stream is not running parallelly.");
    }
    
    r2Parallel.forEach(System.out::println);

}

}
 Output: In Normal
The stream is not running parallelly.
