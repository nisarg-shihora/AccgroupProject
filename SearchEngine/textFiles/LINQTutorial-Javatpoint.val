LINQ Tutorial LINQ tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of LINQ. Our LINQ tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Our LINQ Tutorial includes all topics of LINQ such as introduction, syntax, min function, max function, sum function, count function, sorting operators, etc. What is Linq LinQ is a 'Language Integrated Query.' LINQ provides the new way to manipulate the data, whether it is to or from the database or with an XML file or with a simple list of dynamic data. LINQ is a uniform query system in C# to retrieve the data from different sources of data and formats. It is integrated with C# to eliminate the mismatch between programming language and database. It provides single query interfaces for the different sources of data. For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language that is used to save and retrieve the data from the database. In the same manner, LINQ is a Structured Query Syntax. LINQ is built in C#. It is used to retrieve the data from different types of sources such as XML, docs, collections, ADO.Net DataSet, Web Service, MS SQL Server, and other databases server. Why use LINQ Language-Integrated Query(LINQ) was introduced in C# 3.0 & .NET Framework 3.5. Here we are creating a scenario, suppose one day we are working on SQL Server Database. So, for that, there is a need to learn SQL Server Syntax, SQL related ADO.NET objects. Now after some time, we want to switch to Oracle Database, so again we need to grab command on Oracle related syntax and Oracle related ADO.NET objects to work with C#. This problem arises with the number of technologies we adapt to. Here, in this scenario, we need to learn all the languages. So basically, to avoid this, Microsoft introduces LINQ. In LINQ, we can not only work with populated collections from the database but will work with various other data sources as well, such as an XML file, in the memory-data table, etc. We can use LINQ even when we are working with Reflections. In .Net any data source which implements the IEnumerable interface can be used for querying, filtering, grouping, ordering, & projecting data. We can use LINQ queries in two ways: Query Syntax Method Syntax Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times. Prerequisite Before proceeding to the LINQ tutorial, we should know the implementation of the application using the .NET framework with C# or VB.NET. LINQ operations can be performed either on C# or VB.NET. For that, there is a need to install the Visual Studio in our system. Audience This tutorial is targeted for beginners as well as professional people who are aware of how to implement an application using C# or VB.NET. Problems We assure you that you will not find any problem with the LINQ tutorial. But if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. Next TopicLINQ Introduction next ?

Why use LINQ Language-Integrated Query(LINQ) was introduced in C# 3.0 & .NET Framework 3.5. Here we are creating a scenario, suppose one day we are working on SQL Server Database. So, for that, there is a need to learn SQL Server Syntax, SQL related ADO.NET objects. Now after some time, we want to switch to Oracle Database, so again we need to grab command on Oracle related syntax and Oracle related ADO.NET objects to work with C#. This problem arises with the number of technologies we adapt to. Here, in this scenario, we need to learn all the languages. So basically, to avoid this, Microsoft introduces LINQ. In LINQ, we can not only work with populated collections from the database but will work with various other data sources as well, such as an XML file, in the memory-data table, etc. We can use LINQ even when we are working with Reflections. In .Net any data source which implements the IEnumerable interface can be used for querying, filtering, grouping, ordering, & projecting data. We can use LINQ queries in two ways: Query Syntax Method Syntax Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times. Prerequisite Before proceeding to the LINQ tutorial, we should know the implementation of the application using the .NET framework with C# or VB.NET. LINQ operations can be performed either on C# or VB.NET. For that, there is a need to install the Visual Studio in our system. Audience This tutorial is targeted for beginners as well as professional people who are aware of how to implement an application using C# or VB.NET.

LINQ Tutorial LINQ tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of LINQ. Our LINQ tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Our LINQ Tutorial includes all topics of LINQ such as introduction, syntax, min function, max function, sum function, count function, sorting operators, etc. What is Linq LinQ is a 'Language Integrated Query.' LINQ provides the new way to manipulate the data, whether it is to or from the database or with an XML file or with a simple list of dynamic data. LINQ is a uniform query system in C# to retrieve the data from different sources of data and formats. It is integrated with C# to eliminate the mismatch between programming language and database. It provides single query interfaces for the different sources of data. For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language that is used to save and retrieve the data from the database. In the same manner, LINQ is a Structured Query Syntax. LINQ is built in C#. It is used to retrieve the data from different types of sources such as XML, docs, collections, ADO.Net DataSet, Web Service, MS SQL Server, and other databases server. Why use LINQ Language-Integrated Query(LINQ) was introduced in C# 3.0 & .NET Framework 3.5. Here we are creating a scenario, suppose one day we are working on SQL Server Database. So, for that, there is a need to learn SQL Server Syntax, SQL related ADO.NET objects. Now after some time, we want to switch to Oracle Database, so again we need to grab command on Oracle related syntax and Oracle related ADO.NET objects to work with C#. This problem arises with the number of technologies we adapt to. Here, in this scenario, we need to learn all the languages. So basically, to avoid this, Microsoft introduces LINQ. In LINQ, we can not only work with populated collections from the database but will work with various other data sources as well, such as an XML file, in the memory-data table, etc. We can use LINQ even when we are working with Reflections. In .Net any data source which implements the IEnumerable interface can be used for querying, filtering, grouping, ordering, & projecting data. We can use LINQ queries in two ways: Query Syntax Method Syntax Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times. Prerequisite Before proceeding to the LINQ tutorial, we should know the implementation of the application using the .NET framework with C# or VB.NET. LINQ operations can be performed either on C# or VB.NET. For that, there is a need to install the Visual Studio in our system. Audience This tutorial is targeted for beginners as well as professional people who are aware of how to implement an application using C# or VB.NET. Problems We assure you that you will not find any problem with the LINQ tutorial. But if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. Next TopicLINQ Introduction next ?

LINQ Tutorial LINQ tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of LINQ. Our LINQ tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Our LINQ Tutorial includes all topics of LINQ such as introduction, syntax, min function, max function, sum function, count function, sorting operators, etc. What is Linq LinQ is a 'Language Integrated Query.' LINQ provides the new way to manipulate the data, whether it is to or from the database or with an XML file or with a simple list of dynamic data. LINQ is a uniform query system in C# to retrieve the data from different sources of data and formats. It is integrated with C# to eliminate the mismatch between programming language and database. It provides single query interfaces for the different sources of data. For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language that is used to save and retrieve the data from the database. In the same manner, LINQ is a Structured Query Syntax. LINQ is built in C#. It is used to retrieve the data from different types of sources such as XML, docs, collections, ADO.Net DataSet, Web Service, MS SQL Server, and other databases server. Why use LINQ Language-Integrated Query(LINQ) was introduced in C# 3.0 & .NET Framework 3.5. Here we are creating a scenario, suppose one day we are working on SQL Server Database. So, for that, there is a need to learn SQL Server Syntax, SQL related ADO.NET objects. Now after some time, we want to switch to Oracle Database, so again we need to grab command on Oracle related syntax and Oracle related ADO.NET objects to work with C#. This problem arises with the number of technologies we adapt to. Here, in this scenario, we need to learn all the languages. So basically, to avoid this, Microsoft introduces LINQ. In LINQ, we can not only work with populated collections from the database but will work with various other data sources as well, such as an XML file, in the memory-data table, etc. We can use LINQ even when we are working with Reflections. In .Net any data source which implements the IEnumerable interface can be used for querying, filtering, grouping, ordering, & projecting data. We can use LINQ queries in two ways: Query Syntax Method Syntax Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times. Prerequisite Before proceeding to the LINQ tutorial, we should know the implementation of the application using the .NET framework with C# or VB.NET. LINQ operations can be performed either on C# or VB.NET. For that, there is a need to install the Visual Studio in our system. Audience This tutorial is targeted for beginners as well as professional people who are aware of how to implement an application using C# or VB.NET. Problems We assure you that you will not find any problem with the LINQ tutorial. But if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. Next TopicLINQ Introduction next ?

Our LINQ Tutorial includes all topics of LINQ such as introduction, syntax, min function, max function, sum function, count function, sorting operators, etc. What is Linq LinQ is a 'Language Integrated Query.' LINQ provides the new way to manipulate the data, whether it is to or from the database or with an XML file or with a simple list of dynamic data. LINQ is a uniform query system in C# to retrieve the data from different sources of data and formats. It is integrated with C# to eliminate the mismatch between programming language and database. It provides single query interfaces for the different sources of data. For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language that is used to save and retrieve the data from the database. In the same manner, LINQ is a Structured Query Syntax. LINQ is built in C#. It is used to retrieve the data from different types of sources such as XML, docs, collections, ADO.Net DataSet, Web Service, MS SQL Server, and other databases server. Why use LINQ Language-Integrated Query(LINQ) was introduced in C# 3.0 & .NET Framework 3.5. Here we are creating a scenario, suppose one day we are working on SQL Server Database. So, for that, there is a need to learn SQL Server Syntax, SQL related ADO.NET objects. Now after some time, we want to switch to Oracle Database, so again we need to grab command on Oracle related syntax and Oracle related ADO.NET objects to work with C#. This problem arises with the number of technologies we adapt to. Here, in this scenario, we need to learn all the languages. So basically, to avoid this, Microsoft introduces LINQ. In LINQ, we can not only work with populated collections from the database but will work with various other data sources as well, such as an XML file, in the memory-data table, etc. We can use LINQ even when we are working with Reflections. In .Net any data source which implements the IEnumerable interface can be used for querying, filtering, grouping, ordering, & projecting data. We can use LINQ queries in two ways: Query Syntax Method Syntax Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times. Prerequisite Before proceeding to the LINQ tutorial, we should know the implementation of the application using the .NET framework with C# or VB.NET. LINQ operations can be performed either on C# or VB.NET. For that, there is a need to install the Visual Studio in our system. Audience This tutorial is targeted for beginners as well as professional people who are aware of how to implement an application using C# or VB.NET. Problems We assure you that you will not find any problem with the LINQ tutorial. But if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form. Next TopicLINQ Introduction next ?
