These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14.

The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby.

Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them.

Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes.

These diseases are becoming one of the major medical and research concerns for scientists. What is Bacteria? Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms classified under prokaryotes. They don't either have a definite nucleus or organelles. However, bacteria do possess cell walls in their structure. Bacteria are either good or bad for our bodies. Here, we will give you a list of serious diseases caused by some deadly bacteria. This list has been made from different ancient books and sculptures written in ancient Egyptian and Chinese history. Though we live in a world where all the innovative facilities and medication are subject to concern to prevent the rising cause of death by bacterial infection. Below are some deathly bacterial diseases including: 1. Anthrax The first disease that comes on the top of the list is Anthrax. It is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria are rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium. Anthrax is a severe infection that occurs in three kinds: Skin anthrax, intestinal anthrax, and lung anthrax or pneumonia. All kinds of anthrax can result in death if not treated properly. The bacteria have a long shelf life and have become resistant to high temperatures and radiation. This bacteria is often used to spread bioterrorism. Terrorists release the spore of the bacteria in the place where they don't attack like crowded and public areas to spread the infection or they send letters in which the spores are contained. 2. Tetanus The very next serious infection is tetanus often called lockjaw. It is a lethal bacterial disease that affects the nervous systems and brain. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetanus which secretes an endotoxin that has the ability to paralyze the muscles. The disease can cause problem-related respiration and spasm where the toxin interferes with the nerves involved in the regulation of body movement. The bacteria can come into contact through contaminated saliva by kissing or fecal matter, unhygienic surgical equipment, insect, or animal bite. 3. Leptospirosis It is a bacterial infection that can occur when the sensory organs like eyes, nose or open skin wounds are exposed to soil or water which is contaminated by the bacteria. The bacterium is primarily found in the urination of animals The infection can harm the organs like the kidneys liver, lungs, and brain when not attended to properly. In severe cases, it could lead to death. 4. Tuberculosis The next up in the list is tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a highly infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight heavy sweating at night, and persistent cough that may stay for several months. The causative bacterium of tuberculosis is an airborne bacterium that can be spread through sneezing or coughing from one person to another 5. Pneumonia It is an infection that affects the lungs and is caused by either bacteria, virus or fungi. Pneumonia is caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the case of pneumonia, the alveoli of the lungs get filled with pus making it difficult to breath. Pneumonia symptoms comprise cough, abnormal or shortness of breath, pain in chest, fever, and night chills. 6. Cholera Cholera is caused by bacterium Vibrio chlorae which is often regarded as watery diarrhea and extreme dehydration. Cholera can result in death if not treated properly. Cholera can get into your system by drinking contaminated water or eating bad food that is contaminated with Vibrio. This bacterium is commonly present in regions with poor hygiene, which leads to the production of toxin that can poison the intestines 7. Botulism Botulism is not a common diseases that occur in the body. Yet it is an extremely lethal bacterial disease. Botulism is caused by bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacterium secretes a substance called botulinum which is a type of fatal neurotoxin that can paralyze muscles in the body. Botulism can occur in various forms such as food-borne disease, open wound, infant and respiratory. However, the occurrence of botulism through food is the most common type and also an extremely lethal disease. Amazingly, the causal bacteria of this disease is also the same bacteria that is used to make the anti-aging product Botox. 8. Pseudomonas infection Another type of Pseudomonas infection is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterium is commonly known to cause Pseudomonas infection by targeting the respiratory system through lungs. The disease is lethal for people having cystic fibrosis because this worsen the lungs condition. The bacterium can be found everywhere and therefore can infect people in various modes. Sources of getting the disease are using contaminated surgical tools, food borne, transmitted through physical contact like kissing or intercourse. 9. MRSA infection MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is caused by naturally occurring bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in our nasal passage. MRSA are an advanced strain of Staphylococcus aureus that have become resistant to the antibiotic Methicillin. As the bacterium is highly insensitive to the strongest antibiotics, it is often regarded as Superbug in the world of bacteria. The infection can be fatal and even difficult to treat MRSA infection occur in lungs, blood vessels, and urinary tracts. 10. E.coli infection E.coli infection is caused by the fecal coliform bacterium E.coli. The signs of the infection are similar to diarrhea which is followed by high body temperature (fever). The infection worsens the condition of diarrhea making it watery to even bloody E.coli infection can reach up to other organs like kidneys and may damage them as well if not treated timely. Such events can lead to permanent disability or death. 11. Meningitis It is a type of disease caused by several bacteria that together affect the brain and spinal cord the causal bacteria are Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E.coli and Neisseria meningitidis, During the disease, these bacteria cause swelling of membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and nervous system. Meningitis can easily be transmitted from person to person via sneezing and coughing. It can also spread during the time of delivery when an infected mother gives birth to the baby. The symptoms of meningitis are rigid neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and high sensitivity to light 12. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is the send most contagious sexually transmitted disease. However, AIDS is still positioned as on the first prevalent STD. Gonorrhea is also referred to as the clap. The disease is caused by Neisseria gonorrheae via sexual intercourse. The bacterium get transmitted through sexual contact. If not treated properly or left, it can show sons serious complications in the body. In women, it can lead to infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes while the bacteria may result in infection of the epididymis in men. As per the 2012 systematic review and global reporting, the infection has occurred in 0.6% of men in the population worldwide whereas 0.8% of women in the world's population are suffering from this disease. Therefore, it is very serious for both sexes creating the main cause of infertility. 13. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is regarded as the most common type of plague. It is caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. The symptoms of the bacterial diseases are characterized by the swelling of lymph bulges in the armpits and groin. It is usually spread through the infected flea. The evidence reported that the bubonic plague is assumed to be one of the deadliest bacterial diseases as it has destroyed more than fifty million people in the 1300s. 14. Syphilis Syphilis is another bacterial disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted through sexual contact. The bacterium can also be spread through physical contact and kissing. In addition, pregnant women can also transmit the disease and bacterium to their babies during delivery. The infection spread from sores and can cause damage to your eyes, muscles, and nervous system. 15. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a rare infection usually caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacterium is of cocci shape generally makes colonies on the skin and throat region of the body. These are flesh-eating bacteria that produce endotoxins that cause the destruction of body cells, especially red blood cells and white blood cells. This lead to the death of the infected tissue, thus the process is called as Necrotizing fasciitis. However, not only S.pyogenes cause this disease but E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium, and Klebsiella can also cause Necrotizing fasciitis. The transmission of the bacteria to cause this type of infection is through the open cut or wound on the skin. This could lead to the clear entrance of bacteria into the skin. The disease is not contagious i.e. it does not spread by physical contact as it occurs randomly. People with a strong immune system and proper hygiene and good care of wounds or lesions are at low risk of developing the infection. 16. Dysentery Dysentery is an inflammation in the intestine caused by a bacterium in the Shigella genus. Dysentery is somewhat similar to cholera as it spread through contaminated food and water. Dysentery can also transmit by people who don't maintain proper hygiene like not washing and after using the restroom. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Moreover, the severe symptoms comprise high body temperature, bloody diarrhea, pain. It can be treated at home only by keeping your body hydrated. It can also be treated with antibiotics based on the severity of infection. The best prevention method is to wash and dry your hand properly after using toilet and before eating or handling food. You can also avoid drinking normal water from places where there may be high risk of getting dysentery. There are million of microorganisms present on earth. The above listed diseases are caused by some of the deadly bacteria present on the planet. Now, various researches and innovation are going on to develop medicine that can be used against these bacteria to fight and eliminate them. While they are still in research, what you can do best is to do measures like wash your hand, eat healthy to prevent yourself from getting infected.
