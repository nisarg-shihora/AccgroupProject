Our iOS Development tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. What is iOS? It is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its hardware, for example, iPhone and iPad. It is an operating system that supports the iPhone and iPod Touch; it also provided support for the iPad before introducing iPadOS in 2019. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android. Features of iOS The iOS provides the following features. Multitasking In June 2010, iOS started supporting multitasking in certain devices like iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 3rd Generation with iOS 4. However, in iOS 4, multitasking was supported through the following seven Background APIs. Background audio: application keeps running in the background until it finishes the active audio or video. Voice over IP: The application is suspended when the phone call is not in progress. Background location: notification services when the location of the device changes. Push Notifications: app receives the push notifications from the server, whether it is in background or foreground mode. Local Notifications: Local notifications can be scheduled in the app at a definite time. Task Completion: App can ask the system for extra time to complete a given task. Fast App Switching Apple introduced three new background APIs with iOS 5. Newsstand: the app can download the content in background mode. External Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the external accessories. Bluetooth Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the Bluetooth accessories. Interface Apple iOS provides a user-friendly interface that uses multi-touch gestures like swipe, tap, pinch, etc., to facilitate the users interacting with the applications. The users can trigger any event using switches, buttons and sliders. It uses internal accelerometers to respond to shaking the device or rotating in 3D. The interface home screen is the primary navigation and information hub that contains app icons and widgets to launch the particular applications directly from the home screen. The main page button is located at the top right of the application's screen. The back button is present in the top left of the app's screen. However, to go back, we can use the following ways. Back button at the top left of the display Using swipe-right gesture from the left edge of the app's screen. Press finish action at the top right of the screen. Scroll down on the screen. In-App purchase The iOS users can purchase various content like subscriptions, services and new features within the application. Users can make in-app purchases on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple Pay Apple pay can be integrated into iOS applications to provide an easy and secure way to make payments. The authorization for the apple pay can be done using FaceID and TouchID. Home Screen The home screen in the iOS device contains the widget and app icons to launch the applications. It displays the dock at the bottom where we can pin the most frequently used applications. Whenever we press the home button or unlock the device, the home screen appears. The home screen contains the status bar on the top to display the data. Notification Center The notifications could not be viewed after being dismissed before the release of iOS 5. Apple introduced the Notification Center, where we can see the history of notifications. However, the user can click on a particular notification to open its associated application or clear it from the notification center. Game Center With iOS 4.1, Apple announces a social gaming network where the users can play games with friends. It provides features like a Game center dashboard, leaderboard, achievements, multiplayer and many more. Bluetooth Apple provides the Core Bluetooth framework that provides the classes needed to connect with the Bluetooth-equipped low energy wireless technology. Orientations The iOS applications can be used in portrait and landscape orientations. However, Apple provides size classes in XCode to develop the interface for landscape and portrait orientations. Camera integration Apple provides AVFoundation Capture Subsystem, a common high-level architecture for audio, images, and video capturing services in iOS. Location services With the user's permission, the Location Services allow the applications and website to access the user's device location. The black or white arrow icon is shown in the status bar whenever the location services are active. Maps Apple provides a web mapping service to be used as the default map system for iOS. It includes various features like flyover mode. To develop applications that use maps, we can use MapKit provided by Apple. Accessibility The apple provides various Accessibility features to be used for people with vision and hearing disabilities. The features like voiceover provide a voice reading information that appears on the screen. It allows the user to communicate with the OS with gestures. Apple keeps updating accessibility to provide new features like pronunciation editor, which can be used with the voice over, with iOS 10 in 2016.

Our iOS Development tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. What is iOS? It is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its hardware, for example, iPhone and iPad. It is an operating system that supports the iPhone and iPod Touch; it also provided support for the iPad before introducing iPadOS in 2019. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android. Features of iOS The iOS provides the following features. Multitasking In June 2010, iOS started supporting multitasking in certain devices like iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 3rd Generation with iOS 4. However, in iOS 4, multitasking was supported through the following seven Background APIs. Background audio: application keeps running in the background until it finishes the active audio or video. Voice over IP: The application is suspended when the phone call is not in progress. Background location: notification services when the location of the device changes. Push Notifications: app receives the push notifications from the server, whether it is in background or foreground mode. Local Notifications: Local notifications can be scheduled in the app at a definite time. Task Completion: App can ask the system for extra time to complete a given task. Fast App Switching Apple introduced three new background APIs with iOS 5. Newsstand: the app can download the content in background mode. External Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the external accessories. Bluetooth Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the Bluetooth accessories. Interface Apple iOS provides a user-friendly interface that uses multi-touch gestures like swipe, tap, pinch, etc., to facilitate the users interacting with the applications. The users can trigger any event using switches, buttons and sliders. It uses internal accelerometers to respond to shaking the device or rotating in 3D. The interface home screen is the primary navigation and information hub that contains app icons and widgets to launch the particular applications directly from the home screen. The main page button is located at the top right of the application's screen. The back button is present in the top left of the app's screen. However, to go back, we can use the following ways. Back button at the top left of the display Using swipe-right gesture from the left edge of the app's screen. Press finish action at the top right of the screen. Scroll down on the screen. In-App purchase The iOS users can purchase various content like subscriptions, services and new features within the application. Users can make in-app purchases on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple Pay Apple pay can be integrated into iOS applications to provide an easy and secure way to make payments. The authorization for the apple pay can be done using FaceID and TouchID. Home Screen The home screen in the iOS device contains the widget and app icons to launch the applications. It displays the dock at the bottom where we can pin the most frequently used applications. Whenever we press the home button or unlock the device, the home screen appears. The home screen contains the status bar on the top to display the data. Notification Center The notifications could not be viewed after being dismissed before the release of iOS 5. Apple introduced the Notification Center, where we can see the history of notifications. However, the user can click on a particular notification to open its associated application or clear it from the notification center. Game Center With iOS 4.1, Apple announces a social gaming network where the users can play games with friends. It provides features like a Game center dashboard, leaderboard, achievements, multiplayer and many more. Bluetooth Apple provides the Core Bluetooth framework that provides the classes needed to connect with the Bluetooth-equipped low energy wireless technology. Orientations The iOS applications can be used in portrait and landscape orientations. However, Apple provides size classes in XCode to develop the interface for landscape and portrait orientations. Camera integration Apple provides AVFoundation Capture Subsystem, a common high-level architecture for audio, images, and video capturing services in iOS. Location services With the user's permission, the Location Services allow the applications and website to access the user's device location. The black or white arrow icon is shown in the status bar whenever the location services are active. Maps Apple provides a web mapping service to be used as the default map system for iOS. It includes various features like flyover mode. To develop applications that use maps, we can use MapKit provided by Apple. Accessibility The apple provides various Accessibility features to be used for people with vision and hearing disabilities. The features like voiceover provide a voice reading information that appears on the screen. It allows the user to communicate with the OS with gestures. Apple keeps updating accessibility to provide new features like pronunciation editor, which can be used with the voice over, with iOS 10 in 2016.

Our iOS Development tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. What is iOS? It is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its hardware, for example, iPhone and iPad. It is an operating system that supports the iPhone and iPod Touch; it also provided support for the iPad before introducing iPadOS in 2019. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android. Features of iOS The iOS provides the following features. Multitasking In June 2010, iOS started supporting multitasking in certain devices like iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 3rd Generation with iOS 4. However, in iOS 4, multitasking was supported through the following seven Background APIs. Background audio: application keeps running in the background until it finishes the active audio or video. Voice over IP: The application is suspended when the phone call is not in progress. Background location: notification services when the location of the device changes. Push Notifications: app receives the push notifications from the server, whether it is in background or foreground mode. Local Notifications: Local notifications can be scheduled in the app at a definite time. Task Completion: App can ask the system for extra time to complete a given task. Fast App Switching Apple introduced three new background APIs with iOS 5. Newsstand: the app can download the content in background mode. External Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the external accessories. Bluetooth Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the Bluetooth accessories. Interface Apple iOS provides a user-friendly interface that uses multi-touch gestures like swipe, tap, pinch, etc., to facilitate the users interacting with the applications. The users can trigger any event using switches, buttons and sliders. It uses internal accelerometers to respond to shaking the device or rotating in 3D. The interface home screen is the primary navigation and information hub that contains app icons and widgets to launch the particular applications directly from the home screen. The main page button is located at the top right of the application's screen. The back button is present in the top left of the app's screen. However, to go back, we can use the following ways. Back button at the top left of the display Using swipe-right gesture from the left edge of the app's screen. Press finish action at the top right of the screen. Scroll down on the screen. In-App purchase The iOS users can purchase various content like subscriptions, services and new features within the application. Users can make in-app purchases on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple Pay Apple pay can be integrated into iOS applications to provide an easy and secure way to make payments. The authorization for the apple pay can be done using FaceID and TouchID. Home Screen The home screen in the iOS device contains the widget and app icons to launch the applications. It displays the dock at the bottom where we can pin the most frequently used applications. Whenever we press the home button or unlock the device, the home screen appears. The home screen contains the status bar on the top to display the data. Notification Center The notifications could not be viewed after being dismissed before the release of iOS 5. Apple introduced the Notification Center, where we can see the history of notifications. However, the user can click on a particular notification to open its associated application or clear it from the notification center. Game Center With iOS 4.1, Apple announces a social gaming network where the users can play games with friends. It provides features like a Game center dashboard, leaderboard, achievements, multiplayer and many more. Bluetooth Apple provides the Core Bluetooth framework that provides the classes needed to connect with the Bluetooth-equipped low energy wireless technology.

Our iOS Development tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. What is iOS? It is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its hardware, for example, iPhone and iPad. It is an operating system that supports the iPhone and iPod Touch; it also provided support for the iPad before introducing iPadOS in 2019. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android. Features of iOS The iOS provides the following features. Multitasking In June 2010, iOS started supporting multitasking in certain devices like iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 3rd Generation with iOS 4. However, in iOS 4, multitasking was supported through the following seven Background APIs. Background audio: application keeps running in the background until it finishes the active audio or video. Voice over IP: The application is suspended when the phone call is not in progress. Background location: notification services when the location of the device changes. Push Notifications: app receives the push notifications from the server, whether it is in background or foreground mode. Local Notifications: Local notifications can be scheduled in the app at a definite time. Task Completion: App can ask the system for extra time to complete a given task. Fast App Switching Apple introduced three new background APIs with iOS 5. Newsstand: the app can download the content in background mode. External Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the external accessories. Bluetooth Accessory: the app can communicate and share the data at regular intervals with the Bluetooth accessories. Interface Apple iOS provides a user-friendly interface that uses multi-touch gestures like swipe, tap, pinch, etc., to facilitate the users interacting with the applications. The users can trigger any event using switches, buttons and sliders. It uses internal accelerometers to respond to shaking the device or rotating in 3D. The interface home screen is the primary navigation and information hub that contains app icons and widgets to launch the particular applications directly from the home screen. The main page button is located at the top right of the application's screen. The back button is present in the top left of the app's screen. However, to go back, we can use the following ways. Back button at the top left of the display Using swipe-right gesture from the left edge of the app's screen. Press finish action at the top right of the screen. Scroll down on the screen. In-App purchase The iOS users can purchase various content like subscriptions, services and new features within the application. Users can make in-app purchases on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple Pay Apple pay can be integrated into iOS applications to provide an easy and secure way to make payments. The authorization for the apple pay can be done using FaceID and TouchID. Home Screen The home screen in the iOS device contains the widget and app icons to launch the applications. It displays the dock at the bottom where we can pin the most frequently used applications. Whenever we press the home button or unlock the device, the home screen appears. The home screen contains the status bar on the top to display the data. Notification Center The notifications could not be viewed after being dismissed before the release of iOS 5. Apple introduced the Notification Center, where we can see the history of notifications. However, the user can click on a particular notification to open its associated application or clear it from the notification center. Game Center With iOS 4.1, Apple announces a social gaming network where the users can play games with friends. It provides features like a Game center dashboard, leaderboard, achievements, multiplayer and many more. Bluetooth Apple provides the Core Bluetooth framework that provides the classes needed to connect with the Bluetooth-equipped low energy wireless technology. Orientations The iOS applications can be used in portrait and landscape orientations. However, Apple provides size classes in XCode to develop the interface for landscape and portrait orientations. Camera integration Apple provides AVFoundation Capture Subsystem, a common high-level architecture for audio, images, and video capturing services in iOS. Location services With the user's permission, the Location Services allow the applications and website to access the user's device location. The black or white arrow icon is shown in the status bar whenever the location services are active. Maps Apple provides a web mapping service to be used as the default map system for iOS. It includes various features like flyover mode. To develop applications that use maps, we can use MapKit provided by Apple. Accessibility The apple provides various Accessibility features to be used for people with vision and hearing disabilities. The features like voiceover provide a voice reading information that appears on the screen. It allows the user to communicate with the OS with gestures. Apple keeps updating accessibility to provide new features like pronunciation editor, which can be used with the voice over, with iOS 10 in 2016.
