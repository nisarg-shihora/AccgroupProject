In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was. The homeless puppy was filthy and disgusting. The influenza clinic had seen many incidents of contagious diseases. It was a tale as old as time. The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers. Infinitive phrases are most commonly employed as nouns, however they may also be utilized as adjectives and adverbs. Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints. (adding to the noun "bedsheet" ) Her minimum-favourite electric tool to make home repairs is the saw. (elaborating on the word "electric tool" ) Jacob aimed to publish a book during his career break. (Changes the verb "aimed" ) Sarah is developing a vegetable garden in order to consume natural foods grown in her own yard. (modifying the verb "developing" ) Akbar is running 5 kilometres a day to practice for the Marathon. (altering the verb "running" ) Appositive Phrases Examples An appositive is a noun or the noun phrase that renames the noun immediately preceding it. Its role is to provide information and details about the other noun. Examples of Appositive Phrases A brilliant human rights leader, Joseph left a lasting heritage. Previous Party Leader William passed away at the age of 93. History professor Dave Wilson will reassess the university applications. A small Truck, my vehicle is entirely full. A sweeper and cleaner, my uncle, gobbled up six burgers in one sitting last evening. Hugo, the family cat, sneaked up behind the kids gently. The bookcase, a substantial piece of furnishings, was the first to be hauled into the apartment. The tarantula, a large and hairy beast, terrified the children who were playing in the grass. Kareena's fancy bag, a black Chanel, is damaged with ink as a result of her carelessness. They couldn't imagine it when the tiny boy walked up to Tommy, the college's greatest bully. Participle Phrases Examples A participle phase can be defined as the verb that performs or functions as a modifier. Participles, like adjectives and adverbs, convey additional information about the noun or nouns in a statement. Examples of Participle Phrases The teenagers resting by the street were chatting. Coming to the university, I got to understand the actuality. I was sipping tea in a tumbler made of porcelain. I did the essay while waiting in the reading room. The guy standing by the wood appears to be worried. Designers were expecting you to laze in the cafeteria. Coming to the workplace, I completed the book. Greg always uses tiffin containers made of high-grade plastic. John likes to read sitting solo. The authors are discussing the issue, standing around the tree. Thus, conclusively, these are only some of the instances of various types of phrases. Learning the parts of speech and how they function within sentences and phrases, as well as knowing when to utilize specific phrases to generate the intended impression, are required for effective phrase use. So, begin today by learning a few phrases each day and putting them into practice whenever possible. Next TopicPrepositional Phrase ? prev next ?

In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was. The homeless puppy was filthy and disgusting. The influenza clinic had seen many incidents of contagious diseases. It was a tale as old as time. The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers. Infinitive phrases are most commonly employed as nouns, however they may also be utilized as adjectives and adverbs. Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints. (adding to the noun "bedsheet" ) Her minimum-favourite electric tool to make home repairs is the saw. (elaborating on the word "electric tool" ) Jacob aimed to publish a book during his career break. (Changes the verb "aimed" ) Sarah is developing a vegetable garden in order to consume natural foods grown in her own yard. (modifying the verb "developing" ) Akbar is running 5 kilometres a day to practice for the Marathon. (altering the verb "running" ) Appositive Phrases Examples An appositive is a noun or the noun phrase that renames the noun immediately preceding it. Its role is to provide information and details about the other noun. Examples of Appositive Phrases A brilliant human rights leader, Joseph left a lasting heritage. Previous Party Leader William passed away at the age of 93. History professor Dave Wilson will reassess the university applications. A small Truck, my vehicle is entirely full. A sweeper and cleaner, my uncle, gobbled up six burgers in one sitting last evening. Hugo, the family cat, sneaked up behind the kids gently. The bookcase, a substantial piece of furnishings, was the first to be hauled into the apartment. The tarantula, a large and hairy beast, terrified the children who were playing in the grass. Kareena's fancy bag, a black Chanel, is damaged with ink as a result of her carelessness. They couldn't imagine it when the tiny boy walked up to Tommy, the college's greatest bully. Participle Phrases Examples A participle phase can be defined as the verb that performs or functions as a modifier. Participles, like adjectives and adverbs, convey additional information about the noun or nouns in a statement. Examples of Participle Phrases The teenagers resting by the street were chatting. Coming to the university, I got to understand the actuality. I was sipping tea in a tumbler made of porcelain. I did the essay while waiting in the reading room. The guy standing by the wood appears to be worried. Designers were expecting you to laze in the cafeteria. Coming to the workplace, I completed the book. Greg always uses tiffin containers made of high-grade plastic. John likes to read sitting solo. The authors are discussing the issue, standing around the tree. Thus, conclusively, these are only some of the instances of various types of phrases. Learning the parts of speech and how they function within sentences and phrases, as well as knowing when to utilize specific phrases to generate the intended impression, are required for effective phrase use. So, begin today by learning a few phrases each day and putting them into practice whenever possible. Next TopicPrepositional Phrase ? prev next ?

In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was. The homeless puppy was filthy and disgusting. The influenza clinic had seen many incidents of contagious diseases. It was a tale as old as time. The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers. Infinitive phrases are most commonly employed as nouns, however they may also be utilized as adjectives and adverbs. Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints. (adding to the noun "bedsheet" ) Her minimum-favourite electric tool to make home repairs is the saw. (elaborating on the word "electric tool" ) Jacob aimed to publish a book during his career break. (Changes the verb "aimed" ) Sarah is developing a vegetable garden in order to consume natural foods grown in her own yard.

However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work.

Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints.

(altering the verb "running" ) Appositive Phrases Examples An appositive is a noun or the noun phrase that renames the noun immediately preceding it. Its role is to provide information and details about the other noun. Examples of Appositive Phrases A brilliant human rights leader, Joseph left a lasting heritage. Previous Party Leader William passed away at the age of 93. History professor Dave Wilson will reassess the university applications. A small Truck, my vehicle is entirely full. A sweeper and cleaner, my uncle, gobbled up six burgers in one sitting last evening. Hugo, the family cat, sneaked up behind the kids gently. The bookcase, a substantial piece of furnishings, was the first to be hauled into the apartment. The tarantula, a large and hairy beast, terrified the children who were playing in the grass. Kareena's fancy bag, a black Chanel, is damaged with ink as a result of her carelessness. They couldn't imagine it when the tiny boy walked up to Tommy, the college's greatest bully. Participle Phrases Examples A participle phase can be defined as the verb that performs or functions as a modifier. Participles, like adjectives and adverbs, convey additional information about the noun or nouns in a statement. Examples of Participle Phrases The teenagers resting by the street were chatting. Coming to the university, I got to understand the actuality. I was sipping tea in a tumbler made of porcelain. I did the essay while waiting in the reading room. The guy standing by the wood appears to be worried. Designers were expecting you to laze in the cafeteria. Coming to the workplace, I completed the book. Greg always uses tiffin containers made of high-grade plastic. John likes to read sitting solo. The authors are discussing the issue, standing around the tree. Thus, conclusively, these are only some of the instances of various types of phrases. Learning the parts of speech and how they function within sentences and phrases, as well as knowing when to utilize specific phrases to generate the intended impression, are required for effective phrase use.

In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was.

The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college.

Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized.

The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers. Infinitive phrases are most commonly employed as nouns, however they may also be utilized as adjectives and adverbs. Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints. (adding to the noun "bedsheet" ) Her minimum-favourite electric tool to make home repairs is the saw. (elaborating on the word "electric tool" ) Jacob aimed to publish a book during his career break. (Changes the verb "aimed" ) Sarah is developing a vegetable garden in order to consume natural foods grown in her own yard. (modifying the verb "developing" ) Akbar is running 5 kilometres a day to practice for the Marathon. (altering the verb "running" ) Appositive Phrases Examples An appositive is a noun or the noun phrase that renames the noun immediately preceding it. Its role is to provide information and details about the other noun. Examples of Appositive Phrases A brilliant human rights leader, Joseph left a lasting heritage. Previous Party Leader William passed away at the age of 93. History professor Dave Wilson will reassess the university applications. A small Truck, my vehicle is entirely full. A sweeper and cleaner, my uncle, gobbled up six burgers in one sitting last evening. Hugo, the family cat, sneaked up behind the kids gently. The bookcase, a substantial piece of furnishings, was the first to be hauled into the apartment. The tarantula, a large and hairy beast, terrified the children who were playing in the grass. Kareena's fancy bag, a black Chanel, is damaged with ink as a result of her carelessness. They couldn't imagine it when the tiny boy walked up to Tommy, the college's greatest bully. Participle Phrases Examples A participle phase can be defined as the verb that performs or functions as a modifier. Participles, like adjectives and adverbs, convey additional information about the noun or nouns in a statement. Examples of Participle Phrases The teenagers resting by the street were chatting. Coming to the university, I got to understand the actuality. I was sipping tea in a tumbler made of porcelain. I did the essay while waiting in the reading room. The guy standing by the wood appears to be worried. Designers were expecting you to laze in the cafeteria. Coming to the workplace, I completed the book. Greg always uses tiffin containers made of high-grade plastic. John likes to read sitting solo. The authors are discussing the issue, standing around the tree. Thus, conclusively, these are only some of the instances of various types of phrases. Learning the parts of speech and how they function within sentences and phrases, as well as knowing when to utilize specific phrases to generate the intended impression, are required for effective phrase use.

In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was. The homeless puppy was filthy and disgusting. The influenza clinic had seen many incidents of contagious diseases. It was a tale as old as time. The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers. Infinitive phrases are most commonly employed as nouns, however they may also be utilized as adjectives and adverbs. Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints. (adding to the noun "bedsheet" ) Her minimum-favourite electric tool to make home repairs is the saw. (elaborating on the word "electric tool" ) Jacob aimed to publish a book during his career break. (Changes the verb "aimed" ) Sarah is developing a vegetable garden in order to consume natural foods grown in her own yard. (modifying the verb "developing" ) Akbar is running 5 kilometres a day to practice for the Marathon. (altering the verb "running" ) Appositive Phrases Examples An appositive is a noun or the noun phrase that renames the noun immediately preceding it. Its role is to provide information and details about the other noun. Examples of Appositive Phrases A brilliant human rights leader, Joseph left a lasting heritage. Previous Party Leader William passed away at the age of 93. History professor Dave Wilson will reassess the university applications. A small Truck, my vehicle is entirely full. A sweeper and cleaner, my uncle, gobbled up six burgers in one sitting last evening. Hugo, the family cat, sneaked up behind the kids gently. The bookcase, a substantial piece of furnishings, was the first to be hauled into the apartment. The tarantula, a large and hairy beast, terrified the children who were playing in the grass. Kareena's fancy bag, a black Chanel, is damaged with ink as a result of her carelessness. They couldn't imagine it when the tiny boy walked up to Tommy, the college's greatest bully. Participle Phrases Examples A participle phase can be defined as the verb that performs or functions as a modifier. Participles, like adjectives and adverbs, convey additional information about the noun or nouns in a statement. Examples of Participle Phrases The teenagers resting by the street were chatting. Coming to the university, I got to understand the actuality. I was sipping tea in a tumbler made of porcelain. I did the essay while waiting in the reading room. The guy standing by the wood appears to be worried. Designers were expecting you to laze in the cafeteria. Coming to the workplace, I completed the book. Greg always uses tiffin containers made of high-grade plastic. John likes to read sitting solo. The authors are discussing the issue, standing around the tree. Thus, conclusively, these are only some of the instances of various types of phrases. Learning the parts of speech and how they function within sentences and phrases, as well as knowing when to utilize specific phrases to generate the intended impression, are required for effective phrase use. So, begin today by learning a few phrases each day and putting them into practice whenever possible. Next TopicPrepositional Phrase ? prev next ?

In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was. The homeless puppy was filthy and disgusting. The influenza clinic had seen many incidents of contagious diseases. It was a tale as old as time. The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers. Infinitive phrases are most commonly employed as nouns, however they may also be utilized as adjectives and adverbs. Examples of Infinitive Phrases To commute all across Europe is Lucy's new resolution. Jake's only motive for staying up late is to finish the latest novel. (subject ) A healthy trait to have is to go for exercise in the morning. (object) Katie desires to live a healthy life. (object ) The only way of finding the treasure trove is to meet with the angel. (modifying the noun "way" ) Her fav bed sheet to warm in for bedtime is pink with turquoise floral prints. (adding to the noun "bedsheet" ) Her minimum-favourite electric tool to make home repairs is the saw. (elaborating on the word "electric tool" ) Jacob aimed to publish a book during his career break. (Changes the verb "aimed" ) Sarah is developing a vegetable garden in order to consume natural foods grown in her own yard. (modifying the verb "developing" ) Akbar is running 5 kilometres a day to practice for the Marathon. (altering the verb "running" ) Appositive Phrases Examples An appositive is a noun or the noun phrase that renames the noun immediately preceding it. Its role is to provide information and details about the other noun. Examples of Appositive Phrases A brilliant human rights leader, Joseph left a lasting heritage. Previous Party Leader William passed away at the age of 93. History professor Dave Wilson will reassess the university applications. A small Truck, my vehicle is entirely full. A sweeper and cleaner, my uncle, gobbled up six burgers in one sitting last evening. Hugo, the family cat, sneaked up behind the kids gently. The bookcase, a substantial piece of furnishings, was the first to be hauled into the apartment. The tarantula, a large and hairy beast, terrified the children who were playing in the grass. Kareena's fancy bag, a black Chanel, is damaged with ink as a result of her carelessness. They couldn't imagine it when the tiny boy walked up to Tommy, the college's greatest bully. Participle Phrases Examples A participle phase can be defined as the verb that performs or functions as a modifier. Participles, like adjectives and adverbs, convey additional information about the noun or nouns in a statement. Examples of Participle Phrases The teenagers resting by the street were chatting.

In other terms, it lacks both the subject and the verb. Phrases are meaningful units that can be combined to form statements. Every day, we employ phrases in our writing and speaking. There are many various types of phrases, some of which have a technical purpose in your writings and others which provide an expressive one. Whatever role a phrase plays, it achieves one basic goal: it enriches your statements by providing context, depth, and clarification. Keep in mind that not all phrases are appropriate. Common phrases can sometimes weaken your writing by making you appear less assured or making your message less clear. Noun, verb, gerund, infinitive, appositive, participial, prepositional, and absolute are the eight most popular forms or kinds of phrases. Read and look through our list of phrases below. So, a phrase is a set of words that function as a grammatical unit in syntax and grammar. For example, the English phrase "the very joyful rabbit" is a noun phrase that includes the adjective phrase "very joyful." Phrases can be made up of a single word or a whole sentence. Phrases Examples Read on to explore and discover various types of phrases and examples of phrases. Some of the more common ones are listed here. Noun Phrases Examples A noun phrase is a set of words composed of a noun with all its modifiers. Below are some of the examples of noun phrases The befuddled traveller had no idea where he was. The homeless puppy was filthy and disgusting. The influenza clinic had seen many incidents of contagious diseases. It was a tale as old as time. The lengthy and twisting road was driven by the racing motorcar. Sunday became a rainy and awesome afternoon. The second black cat on the desk is very beautiful. The professor is standing in the new hallway. The happy woman drove the scooter down the green and clean village. The naughty rabbit climbed on the car's seat. Verb Phrases Examples A verb phrase is a collection of words that includes a verb, any supporting verbs, as well as any modifier. Similar to adverbial phrases, the verb phrases play the role of the verbs in the statement wherever it is placed or positioned. Below are some of the examples of the verb phrases She was waiting for the storm to subside. Mary was disappointed when it did not cook. You've been resting for quite some time. They might love the spa treatment. He was keen to make lunch. Maria was reading the novel. She has been sitting on my sofa. The kids are playing chess. Sheena might be standing outside the college. Suraj is helping his collegemate re-locate. Prepositional Phrases Examples A prepositional phrase is a collection of words that start with a preposition and illustrate the link between two items. Prepositional phrases can be used as an adverb (adverb phrase), adjectives (adjective phrase), and even nouns in specific cases. Below are some of the examples of prepositional phrases The magazine was placed on the study desk. We tented next to the stream. He could see it over the rainbows. She was lost in the blackness of night. He found himself between a rock and a cliff. I waited for quite some time. Helen smelled of peaches and cream. John won the contest against all odds. The laptop was on the dinner table. The cat sat below the office desk. Absolute Phrases Examples An absolute phrase always comprises the subject but no action verb. It cannot remain on its own as the full sentence. It changes the entire statement, not just a noun. Here are several examples: His ears raised high; the dog ran into the room. Her tail straight, the cat yelled at the window. Barbeque items in hand, she arranged for her date night. The kids snatched the bowl of chips, their hands getting the last bit of tomato ketchup off the tray. Their hands folded; the entire college batch apologized. The entire squad, their outfits wet and stained, yelled with delight. Its leaves covered in snow; the tree stood in the wintertime. Being a scholar, you must be aware of this. Cutting the vegetables, Seema was watching the show on her laptop. Being a dancer, she has good knowledge of trends, style and moves. Gerund Examples Gerund phrases are usually noun phrases that start with a gerund. Gerund phrases, like participle phrases, commence with the -ing verb form and include its objects and modifiers. However, the gerund phrase most of the time is used as a noun in a statement and never as an adjective. The gerund phrases, like all other nouns, may function as the subjects of the statement or sentence, the objects of the verbs or prepositions, or the complements of the linking verb. Examples of Gerund Phrases Reading spiritual books can be very calming. Fishing with buddies allows me to relax. Composing emails is a means of exchanging thoughts. Tobacco smoking is not prohibited at restaurants. Feeling sorry for me is just not sufficient this time. I like shopping with my buddies. My father avoids preparing large meals. Training to score goals, the squad was upskilled. We have no objections to financing the car. She contemplated quitting her work. Infinitive Phrases Examples An infinitive phrase includes an infinitive (for instance, to eat, to move, to contemplate, to throw) as well as its objects and modifiers.
