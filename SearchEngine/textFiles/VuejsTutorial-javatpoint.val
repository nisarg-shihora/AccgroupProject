Vue.js Tutorial Vue.js tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Vue.js. Our Vue.js Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. In this tutorial, you will learn what is Vue.js, how to install Vue.js, Vue.js Instances, Components, Properties, Bindings, Events, Rendering, Directives, Routing, Mixins, Render functions etc. What is Vue.js? Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view." What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed. Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications. History of Vue.js Vue.js was created by Evan You, who was then working for Google using AngularJS in their projects. He extracted some parts of AngularJS and built something lightweight JavaScript framework later released as Vue.js. The first version of Vue.js was released in February 2014. It is now maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. All released versions of Vue.js Following is the list of all the released versions of Vue.js: Version Release date Title of the version 0.6 Dec 8, 2013 N/A 0.7 Dec 24, 2013 N/A 0.8 Jan 27, 2014 N/A 0.9 Feb 25, 2014 Animatrix 0.10 Mar 23, 2014 Blade Runner 0.11 Nov 7, 2014 Cowboy Bebop 0.12 Jun 12, 2015 Dragon Ball 1.0 Oct 27, 2015 Evangelion 2.0 Sep 30,2016 Ghost in the Shell 2.1 Nov 22, 2016 Hunter X Hunter 2.2 Feb 26, 2017 Initial D 2.3 Apr 27, 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 2.4 Jul 13, 2017 Kill la Kill 2.5 Oct 13, 2017 Level E 2.6 Feb 4, 2019 Sword Art Onlin: Alicization Features of Vue.js Following is the list of most prominent features of Vue.js: Components Vue.js Components are one of the important features of this framework. They are used to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. You can create reusable custom elements in Vue.js applications that can be later reused in HTML. Templates Vue.js provides HTML-based templates that can be used to bind the rendered DOM with the Vue instance data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue.js compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Vue renders components in virtual DOM memory before updating the browser. Vue can also calculate the minimum number of components to re-render and apply the minimum amount of DOM manipulations when you change the application's state. Reactivity Vue provides a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimizes re-rendering. In this process, each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies, so the system knows precisely when, and which components to re-render. Routing Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router. You can use the officially-supported vue-router library for your Single Page Application or if you only need a simple routing and do not want to use the full-featured router library, you can do this by dynamically rendering a page-level component as following: 
const NotFound = { template: '<p>Page not found</p>' }
const Home = { template: '<p>home page</p>' }
const About = { template: '<p>about page</p>' }
const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentRoute: window.location.pathname
  },
  computed: {
    ViewComponent () {
      return routes[this.currentRoute] || NotFound
    }
  },
  render (h) { return h(this.ViewComponent) }
})
 Transitions Vue allows you to use different transition effects when the items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM.

Vue.js Tutorial Vue.js tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Vue.js. Our Vue.js Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. In this tutorial, you will learn what is Vue.js, how to install Vue.js, Vue.js Instances, Components, Properties, Bindings, Events, Rendering, Directives, Routing, Mixins, Render functions etc. What is Vue.js? Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view." What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed. Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications. History of Vue.js Vue.js was created by Evan You, who was then working for Google using AngularJS in their projects. He extracted some parts of AngularJS and built something lightweight JavaScript framework later released as Vue.js. The first version of Vue.js was released in February 2014. It is now maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. All released versions of Vue.js Following is the list of all the released versions of Vue.js: Version Release date Title of the version 0.6 Dec 8, 2013 N/A 0.7 Dec 24, 2013 N/A 0.8 Jan 27, 2014 N/A 0.9 Feb 25, 2014 Animatrix 0.10 Mar 23, 2014 Blade Runner 0.11 Nov 7, 2014 Cowboy Bebop 0.12 Jun 12, 2015 Dragon Ball 1.0 Oct 27, 2015 Evangelion 2.0 Sep 30,2016 Ghost in the Shell 2.1 Nov 22, 2016 Hunter X Hunter 2.2 Feb 26, 2017 Initial D 2.3 Apr 27, 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 2.4 Jul 13, 2017 Kill la Kill 2.5 Oct 13, 2017 Level E 2.6 Feb 4, 2019 Sword Art Onlin: Alicization Features of Vue.js Following is the list of most prominent features of Vue.js: Components Vue.js Components are one of the important features of this framework. They are used to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. You can create reusable custom elements in Vue.js applications that can be later reused in HTML. Templates Vue.js provides HTML-based templates that can be used to bind the rendered DOM with the Vue instance data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue.js compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Vue renders components in virtual DOM memory before updating the browser. Vue can also calculate the minimum number of components to re-render and apply the minimum amount of DOM manipulations when you change the application's state. Reactivity Vue provides a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimizes re-rendering. In this process, each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies, so the system knows precisely when, and which components to re-render. Routing Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router. You can use the officially-supported vue-router library for your Single Page Application or if you only need a simple routing and do not want to use the full-featured router library, you can do this by dynamically rendering a page-level component as following: 
const NotFound = { template: '<p>Page not found</p>' }
const Home = { template: '<p>home page</p>' }
const About = { template: '<p>about page</p>' }
const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentRoute: window.location.pathname
  },
  computed: {
    ViewComponent () {
      return routes[this.currentRoute] || NotFound
    }
  },
  render (h) { return h(this.ViewComponent) }
})
 Transitions Vue allows you to use different transition effects when the items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. Prerequisites Before learning Vue.js in depth, you must have the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Audience We have developed this Vue.js tutorial for beginners and professionals both.

Vue.js Tutorial Vue.js tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Vue.js. Our Vue.js Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. In this tutorial, you will learn what is Vue.js, how to install Vue.js, Vue.js Instances, Components, Properties, Bindings, Events, Rendering, Directives, Routing, Mixins, Render functions etc. What is Vue.js? Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view." What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed. Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications. History of Vue.js Vue.js was created by Evan You, who was then working for Google using AngularJS in their projects. He extracted some parts of AngularJS and built something lightweight JavaScript framework later released as Vue.js. The first version of Vue.js was released in February 2014. It is now maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. All released versions of Vue.js Following is the list of all the released versions of Vue.js: Version Release date Title of the version 0.6 Dec 8, 2013 N/A 0.7 Dec 24, 2013 N/A 0.8 Jan 27, 2014 N/A 0.9 Feb 25, 2014 Animatrix 0.10 Mar 23, 2014 Blade Runner 0.11 Nov 7, 2014 Cowboy Bebop 0.12 Jun 12, 2015 Dragon Ball 1.0 Oct 27, 2015 Evangelion 2.0 Sep 30,2016 Ghost in the Shell 2.1 Nov 22, 2016 Hunter X Hunter 2.2 Feb 26, 2017 Initial D 2.3 Apr 27, 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 2.4 Jul 13, 2017 Kill la Kill 2.5 Oct 13, 2017 Level E 2.6 Feb 4, 2019 Sword Art Onlin: Alicization Features of Vue.js Following is the list of most prominent features of Vue.js: Components Vue.js Components are one of the important features of this framework. They are used to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. You can create reusable custom elements in Vue.js applications that can be later reused in HTML. Templates Vue.js provides HTML-based templates that can be used to bind the rendered DOM with the Vue instance data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue.js compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Vue renders components in virtual DOM memory before updating the browser. Vue can also calculate the minimum number of components to re-render and apply the minimum amount of DOM manipulations when you change the application's state. Reactivity Vue provides a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimizes re-rendering. In this process, each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies, so the system knows precisely when, and which components to re-render. Routing Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router. You can use the officially-supported vue-router library for your Single Page Application or if you only need a simple routing and do not want to use the full-featured router library, you can do this by dynamically rendering a page-level component as following: 
const NotFound = { template: '<p>Page not found</p>' }
const Home = { template: '<p>home page</p>' }
const About = { template: '<p>about page</p>' }
const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentRoute: window.location.pathname
  },
  computed: {
    ViewComponent () {
      return routes[this.currentRoute] || NotFound
    }
  },
  render (h) { return h(this.ViewComponent) }
})
 Transitions Vue allows you to use different transition effects when the items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. Prerequisites Before learning Vue.js in depth, you must have the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Audience We have developed this Vue.js tutorial for beginners and professionals both.

Vue.js Tutorial Vue.js tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Vue.js. Our Vue.js Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. In this tutorial, you will learn what is Vue.js, how to install Vue.js, Vue.js Instances, Components, Properties, Bindings, Events, Rendering, Directives, Routing, Mixins, Render functions etc. What is Vue.js? Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view." What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed. Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications. History of Vue.js Vue.js was created by Evan You, who was then working for Google using AngularJS in their projects. He extracted some parts of AngularJS and built something lightweight JavaScript framework later released as Vue.js. The first version of Vue.js was released in February 2014. It is now maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. All released versions of Vue.js Following is the list of all the released versions of Vue.js: Version Release date Title of the version 0.6 Dec 8, 2013 N/A 0.7 Dec 24, 2013 N/A 0.8 Jan 27, 2014 N/A 0.9 Feb 25, 2014 Animatrix 0.10 Mar 23, 2014 Blade Runner 0.11 Nov 7, 2014 Cowboy Bebop 0.12 Jun 12, 2015 Dragon Ball 1.0 Oct 27, 2015 Evangelion 2.0 Sep 30,2016 Ghost in the Shell 2.1 Nov 22, 2016 Hunter X Hunter 2.2 Feb 26, 2017 Initial D 2.3 Apr 27, 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 2.4 Jul 13, 2017 Kill la Kill 2.5 Oct 13, 2017 Level E 2.6 Feb 4, 2019 Sword Art Onlin: Alicization Features of Vue.js Following is the list of most prominent features of Vue.js: Components Vue.js Components are one of the important features of this framework. They are used to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. You can create reusable custom elements in Vue.js applications that can be later reused in HTML. Templates Vue.js provides HTML-based templates that can be used to bind the rendered DOM with the Vue instance data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue.js compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Vue renders components in virtual DOM memory before updating the browser. Vue can also calculate the minimum number of components to re-render and apply the minimum amount of DOM manipulations when you change the application's state. Reactivity Vue provides a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimizes re-rendering. In this process, each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies, so the system knows precisely when, and which components to re-render. Routing Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router. You can use the officially-supported vue-router library for your Single Page Application or if you only need a simple routing and do not want to use the full-featured router library, you can do this by dynamically rendering a page-level component as following: 
const NotFound = { template: '<p>Page not found</p>' }
const Home = { template: '<p>home page</p>' }
const About = { template: '<p>about page</p>' }
const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentRoute: window.location.pathname
  },
  computed: {
    ViewComponent () {
      return routes[this.currentRoute] || NotFound
    }
  },
  render (h) { return h(this.ViewComponent) }
})
 Transitions Vue allows you to use different transition effects when the items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. Prerequisites Before learning Vue.js in depth, you must have the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Audience We have developed this Vue.js tutorial for beginners and professionals both.

Vue.js Tutorial Vue.js tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Vue.js. Our Vue.js Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. In this tutorial, you will learn what is Vue.js, how to install Vue.js, Vue.js Instances, Components, Properties, Bindings, Events, Rendering, Directives, Routing, Mixins, Render functions etc. What is Vue.js? Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view." What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed. Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications. History of Vue.js Vue.js was created by Evan You, who was then working for Google using AngularJS in their projects. He extracted some parts of AngularJS and built something lightweight JavaScript framework later released as Vue.js. The first version of Vue.js was released in February 2014. It is now maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. All released versions of Vue.js Following is the list of all the released versions of Vue.js: Version Release date Title of the version 0.6 Dec 8, 2013 N/A 0.7 Dec 24, 2013 N/A 0.8 Jan 27, 2014 N/A 0.9 Feb 25, 2014 Animatrix 0.10 Mar 23, 2014 Blade Runner 0.11 Nov 7, 2014 Cowboy Bebop 0.12 Jun 12, 2015 Dragon Ball 1.0 Oct 27, 2015 Evangelion 2.0 Sep 30,2016 Ghost in the Shell 2.1 Nov 22, 2016 Hunter X Hunter 2.2 Feb 26, 2017 Initial D 2.3 Apr 27, 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 2.4 Jul 13, 2017 Kill la Kill 2.5 Oct 13, 2017 Level E 2.6 Feb 4, 2019 Sword Art Onlin: Alicization Features of Vue.js Following is the list of most prominent features of Vue.js: Components Vue.js Components are one of the important features of this framework. They are used to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. You can create reusable custom elements in Vue.js applications that can be later reused in HTML. Templates Vue.js provides HTML-based templates that can be used to bind the rendered DOM with the Vue instance data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue.js compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Vue renders components in virtual DOM memory before updating the browser. Vue can also calculate the minimum number of components to re-render and apply the minimum amount of DOM manipulations when you change the application's state. Reactivity Vue provides a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimizes re-rendering. In this process, each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies, so the system knows precisely when, and which components to re-render. Routing Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router. You can use the officially-supported vue-router library for your Single Page Application or if you only need a simple routing and do not want to use the full-featured router library, you can do this by dynamically rendering a page-level component as following: 
const NotFound = { template: '<p>Page not found</p>' }
const Home = { template: '<p>home page</p>' }
const About = { template: '<p>about page</p>' }
const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentRoute: window.location.pathname
  },
  computed: {
    ViewComponent () {
      return routes[this.currentRoute] || NotFound
    }
  },
  render (h) { return h(this.ViewComponent) }
})
 Transitions Vue allows you to use different transition effects when the items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. Prerequisites Before learning Vue.js in depth, you must have the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Audience We have developed this Vue.js tutorial for beginners and professionals both.

Vue.js Tutorial Vue.js tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Vue.js. Our Vue.js Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. In this tutorial, you will learn what is Vue.js, how to install Vue.js, Vue.js Instances, Components, Properties, Bindings, Events, Rendering, Directives, Routing, Mixins, Render functions etc. What is Vue.js? Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view." What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed. Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications. History of Vue.js Vue.js was created by Evan You, who was then working for Google using AngularJS in their projects. He extracted some parts of AngularJS and built something lightweight JavaScript framework later released as Vue.js. The first version of Vue.js was released in February 2014. It is now maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces. All released versions of Vue.js Following is the list of all the released versions of Vue.js: Version Release date Title of the version 0.6 Dec 8, 2013 N/A 0.7 Dec 24, 2013 N/A 0.8 Jan 27, 2014 N/A 0.9 Feb 25, 2014 Animatrix 0.10 Mar 23, 2014 Blade Runner 0.11 Nov 7, 2014 Cowboy Bebop 0.12 Jun 12, 2015 Dragon Ball 1.0 Oct 27, 2015 Evangelion 2.0 Sep 30,2016 Ghost in the Shell 2.1 Nov 22, 2016 Hunter X Hunter 2.2 Feb 26, 2017 Initial D 2.3 Apr 27, 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 2.4 Jul 13, 2017 Kill la Kill 2.5 Oct 13, 2017 Level E 2.6 Feb 4, 2019 Sword Art Onlin: Alicization Features of Vue.js Following is the list of most prominent features of Vue.js: Components Vue.js Components are one of the important features of this framework. They are used to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. You can create reusable custom elements in Vue.js applications that can be later reused in HTML. Templates Vue.js provides HTML-based templates that can be used to bind the rendered DOM with the Vue instance data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue.js compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Vue renders components in virtual DOM memory before updating the browser. Vue can also calculate the minimum number of components to re-render and apply the minimum amount of DOM manipulations when you change the application's state. Reactivity Vue provides a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimizes re-rendering. In this process, each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies, so the system knows precisely when, and which components to re-render. Routing Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router. You can use the officially-supported vue-router library for your Single Page Application or if you only need a simple routing and do not want to use the full-featured router library, you can do this by dynamically rendering a page-level component as following: 
const NotFound = { template: '<p>Page not found</p>' }
const Home = { template: '<p>home page</p>' }
const About = { template: '<p>about page</p>' }
const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentRoute: window.location.pathname
  },
  computed: {
    ViewComponent () {
      return routes[this.currentRoute] || NotFound
    }
  },
  render (h) { return h(this.ViewComponent) }
})
 Transitions Vue allows you to use different transition effects when the items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. Prerequisites Before learning Vue.js in depth, you must have the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Audience We have developed this Vue.js tutorial for beginners and professionals both.
