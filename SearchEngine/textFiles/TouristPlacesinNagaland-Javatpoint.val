After learning so much about Nagaland, we can be certain that visiting this state, if it's on a traveller's bucket list, would be a colourful experience.

For the Asian superpower India, this geographical area has crucial geopolitical significance. It encompasses eight different states, each of which has its unique mountainous beauty that allows visitors to lose themselves in a completely different setting. Because the Siliguri corridor connects all seven of the states-Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, and others-they are collectively referred to as sisters. The seven sisters can only be reached in this manner.

For the Asian superpower India, this geographical area has crucial geopolitical significance.
