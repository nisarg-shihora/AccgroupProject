But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category. Brands are constantly trying their best to capture the common market of regular car owners. They are challenged with providing better quality while maintaining the best price in order to reign supreme as Best Sellers. We will be taking a look at both the categories and some of the best ones they have to offer. LUXURY CARS 1. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ (? 28.40 Crore) The Chiron Super Sport 300+ from Bugatti is known for its record-breaking top speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph.

Powered by the 8.0 l W16 engine and with a torque of 1600 NM, the car accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in mere 2.4 seconds and boasts a power of 1577 hp. The car is a beast itself, but the design of the car is no less. With perfect and fine bodywork running on lightweight magnesium wheels, a comfortable and luxurious interior, and a well-thought colour scheme, this car is sure as aesthetically pleasing as it could've been. There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. The fuel tank has a 100 L capacity. 2. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (? 6.25 Crore) How could one make a list of luxury supercars and not mention Lamborghini in it?

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category. Brands are constantly trying their best to capture the common market of regular car owners. They are challenged with providing better quality while maintaining the best price in order to reign supreme as Best Sellers. We will be taking a look at both the categories and some of the best ones they have to offer. LUXURY CARS 1.

The car is a beast itself, but the design of the car is no less. With perfect and fine bodywork running on lightweight magnesium wheels, a comfortable and luxurious interior, and a well-thought colour scheme, this car is sure as aesthetically pleasing as it could've been. There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. The fuel tank has a 100 L capacity. 2. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (? 6.25 Crore) How could one make a list of luxury supercars and not mention Lamborghini in it?

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category. Brands are constantly trying their best to capture the common market of regular car owners. They are challenged with providing better quality while maintaining the best price in order to reign supreme as Best Sellers. We will be taking a look at both the categories and some of the best ones they have to offer. LUXURY CARS 1. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ (? 28.40 Crore) The Chiron Super Sport 300+ from Bugatti is known for its record-breaking top speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph.

The car is a beast itself, but the design of the car is no less. With perfect and fine bodywork running on lightweight magnesium wheels, a comfortable and luxurious interior, and a well-thought colour scheme, this car is sure as aesthetically pleasing as it could've been. There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. The fuel tank has a 100 L capacity. 2. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (? 6.25 Crore) How could one make a list of luxury supercars and not mention Lamborghini in it?

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category.

They are challenged with providing better quality while maintaining the best price in order to reign supreme as Best Sellers.

With perfect and fine bodywork running on lightweight magnesium wheels, a comfortable and luxurious interior, and a well-thought colour scheme, this car is sure as aesthetically pleasing as it could've been. There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well.

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category.

With perfect and fine bodywork running on lightweight magnesium wheels, a comfortable and luxurious interior, and a well-thought colour scheme, this car is sure as aesthetically pleasing as it could've been. There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well.

The fuel tank has a 100 L capacity. 2. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (? 6.25 Crore) How could one make a list of luxury supercars and not mention Lamborghini in it?

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category.

There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well.

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category.

There are only 30 units of these manufactured and sold by Bugatti, so getting your hands on one is a serious feat not only because of the price but because of its rarity as well.

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars. While the luxury models continue to aim for the top, the competition is actually even more intense within the middle price category.

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars.

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars.

But it is not entirely impossible; some of the brands just put everything in order to make something elite which is overall superior to others. This competition has led to some cars which truly define what 'best' means. Whether it's about newer technology built into them, the expensive and premium material used to build them, or specs you have always dreamt of, the top brands have not failed in any category which has made them claim the title of supercars.
