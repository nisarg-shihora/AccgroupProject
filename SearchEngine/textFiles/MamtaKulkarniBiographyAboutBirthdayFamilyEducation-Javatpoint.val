How her career ended The controversy about her career started with the film China Gate, whose director was Rajkumar Santoshi. The Relation between them worsened when Rajkumar dropped her from the movie as a lead role. It is said that when he dropped her, he received threats from underworld don Chhota Rajan to take her in his film. Rajkumar was now forced to take her in that film. When the film was released, it didn't perform well at the box office. Still, Urmila Matondhkar's featured song in the movie Chamma Chamma became very popular, and Urmila got all the applause and popularity from the public despite Mamta. Mamta got immensely angered and held Rajkumar responsible for the failure, accusing him of cutting her screen time for not fulling his desires.

Later she did some regional movies in Bengali and Malayalam, and her last Hindi movie was "Kabhi Hum Kabhi Tum". This incident was the real reason behind the end of her journey. Her relationship with Vicky Goswami At the end of the 90s, many Indian actresses who were not getting movie offers started doing dance performances in Dubai, for which they were paid very well, as Bollywood celebrities were hit then. The same happened with Mamta, who also did various dance nights in Dubai. During one of her shows, she met Vicky Goswami. At that time, he had a hotel and Food Pulp Processing Business in Dubai as a front legal business, but he was a drug dealer who had business connections with Velden Findley, a Zambian drug lord. Due to Mamta's frequent visits to Dubai, their meeting increased, and they became close. But after some time, Vicky was arrested in a drug case in Dubai and punished with capital punishment. When he went to jail, he gave all the responsibility of his legal business to Mamta because he didn't have faith in anyone. Mamta took care of his business very well in his absence. She had good connections as she used to do shows for wealthy people in Dubai; she worked very hard and did not leave any stones unturned to take Vicky out of jail. With those rich people's help, firstly, she managed to cancel the death penalty, and then she successfully got the benefits of various leaves given to the prisoners to Vicky. Finally, due to her efforts, Vicky was released from jail on the ground of good behaviour in just eight years. When all these things were happening with Vicky, Mamta lost her mother. Now she was alone, and in Dubai, Vicky was also alone. Then she decided to leave the film industry and went to Dubai to live with Vicky. According to some reports, Mamta married Vicky in 2013, but whenever she was asked about her marriage, she refused to accept this every time. She ways said she had a good relationship with Vicky. Top Controversies related to Mamta Topless pose Mamta's topless pose picture was published in Stardust Magazine in 1993. The public criticized her for such boldness; none were comfortable with that.

How her career ended The controversy about her career started with the film China Gate, whose director was Rajkumar Santoshi. The Relation between them worsened when Rajkumar dropped her from the movie as a lead role. It is said that when he dropped her, he received threats from underworld don Chhota Rajan to take her in his film. Rajkumar was now forced to take her in that film. When the film was released, it didn't perform well at the box office. Still, Urmila Matondhkar's featured song in the movie Chamma Chamma became very popular, and Urmila got all the applause and popularity from the public despite Mamta. Mamta got immensely angered and held Rajkumar responsible for the failure, accusing him of cutting her screen time for not fulling his desires.

Later she did some regional movies in Bengali and Malayalam, and her last Hindi movie was "Kabhi Hum Kabhi Tum". This incident was the real reason behind the end of her journey. Her relationship with Vicky Goswami At the end of the 90s, many Indian actresses who were not getting movie offers started doing dance performances in Dubai, for which they were paid very well, as Bollywood celebrities were hit then. The same happened with Mamta, who also did various dance nights in Dubai. During one of her shows, she met Vicky Goswami. At that time, he had a hotel and Food Pulp Processing Business in Dubai as a front legal business, but he was a drug dealer who had business connections with Velden Findley, a Zambian drug lord. Due to Mamta's frequent visits to Dubai, their meeting increased, and they became close. But after some time, Vicky was arrested in a drug case in Dubai and punished with capital punishment. When he went to jail, he gave all the responsibility of his legal business to Mamta because he didn't have faith in anyone. Mamta took care of his business very well in his absence. She had good connections as she used to do shows for wealthy people in Dubai; she worked very hard and did not leave any stones unturned to take Vicky out of jail. With those rich people's help, firstly, she managed to cancel the death penalty, and then she successfully got the benefits of various leaves given to the prisoners to Vicky. Finally, due to her efforts, Vicky was released from jail on the ground of good behaviour in just eight years. When all these things were happening with Vicky, Mamta lost her mother. Now she was alone, and in Dubai, Vicky was also alone. Then she decided to leave the film industry and went to Dubai to live with Vicky. According to some reports, Mamta married Vicky in 2013, but whenever she was asked about her marriage, she refused to accept this every time. She ways said she had a good relationship with Vicky. Top Controversies related to Mamta Topless pose Mamta's topless pose picture was published in Stardust Magazine in 1993. The public criticized her for such boldness; none were comfortable with that.

How her career ended The controversy about her career started with the film China Gate, whose director was Rajkumar Santoshi.

It is said that when he dropped her, he received threats from underworld don Chhota Rajan to take her in his film. Rajkumar was now forced to take her in that film. When the film was released, it didn't perform well at the box office. Still, Urmila Matondhkar's featured song in the movie Chamma Chamma became very popular, and Urmila got all the applause and popularity from the public despite Mamta. Mamta got immensely angered and held Rajkumar responsible for the failure, accusing him of cutting her screen time for not fulling his desires.

Later she did some regional movies in Bengali and Malayalam, and her last Hindi movie was "Kabhi Hum Kabhi Tum". This incident was the real reason behind the end of her journey. Her relationship with Vicky Goswami At the end of the 90s, many Indian actresses who were not getting movie offers started doing dance performances in Dubai, for which they were paid very well, as Bollywood celebrities were hit then.

Due to Mamta's frequent visits to Dubai, their meeting increased, and they became close. But after some time, Vicky was arrested in a drug case in Dubai and punished with capital punishment. When he went to jail, he gave all the responsibility of his legal business to Mamta because he didn't have faith in anyone. Mamta took care of his business very well in his absence. She had good connections as she used to do shows for wealthy people in Dubai; she worked very hard and did not leave any stones unturned to take Vicky out of jail. With those rich people's help, firstly, she managed to cancel the death penalty, and then she successfully got the benefits of various leaves given to the prisoners to Vicky. Finally, due to her efforts, Vicky was released from jail on the ground of good behaviour in just eight years. When all these things were happening with Vicky, Mamta lost her mother. Now she was alone, and in Dubai, Vicky was also alone. Then she decided to leave the film industry and went to Dubai to live with Vicky. According to some reports, Mamta married Vicky in 2013, but whenever she was asked about her marriage, she refused to accept this every time. She ways said she had a good relationship with Vicky. Top Controversies related to Mamta Topless pose Mamta's topless pose picture was published in Stardust Magazine in 1993. The public criticized her for such boldness; none were comfortable with that.
