Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived

Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived

Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived

Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived

Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived

Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived

Variables are passed by reference in C++ for the following reasons: 1) To change the caller function's local variables: A reference (or pointer) allows the called function to modify a caller function's local variable. Consider the following example programme, in which fun() can change the local variable x of main (). C++ Code 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(int& x) { x = 20; }

int main()
{
	int x = 10;
	fun(x);
	cout << "New value of x is " << x;
	return 0;
}
 Output: New value of x is 20
 2) When passing large arguments: When passing a large argument, passing by reference (or pointer) is more efficient because only an address is passed, not the entire object. Consider the following Employee class and the function printEmpDetails(), which prints Employee details. C Code 
class Employee {
private:
	string name;
	string desig;

	// More attributes and operations
};

void printEmpDetails(Employee emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 The problem with above code is: every time printEmpDetails () is called, a new Employee object is constructed that involves creating a copy of all data members. So a better implementation would be to pass Employee as a reference. 
void printEmpDetails(const Employee& emp)
{
	cout << emp.getName();
	cout << emp.getDesig();

	// Print more attributes
}
 This is only true for struct and class variables because basic types like int, char, and so on have no efficiency advantage. 3) To avoid Object Slicing: If we pass a subclass object to a function that expects a superclass object, the passed object is sliced if it is passed by value. Consider the following programme, which prints "This is Pet Class." C Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(Pet p)
{ // Slices the derived class object
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Pet Class
 When we use pass by reference in the above programme, it prints " This is Dog Class " correctly. See the modified programme below. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Pet class";
	}
};

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
	virtual string getDescription() const
	{
		return "This is Dog class";
	}
};

void describe(const Pet& p)
{ // Doesn't slice the derived class object.
	cout << p.getDescription() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
	Dog d;
	describe(d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: This is Dog Class
 This is also not true for basic data types such as int, char, and so on. 4) Obtaining Run Time Polymorphism in a Function: By passing objects as references (or pointers) to a function, we can make it polymorphic. In the following programme, for example, print() receives a reference to the base class object. If a base class object is passed, the function print() calls the base class function show(), and if a derived class object is passed, the function show() is called. C++ Code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void show()
	{ // Note the virtual keyword here
		cout << "In base\n";
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void show () { cout << "In derived\n"; }
};

// Since we pass b as reference, we achieve run time
// polymorphism here.
void print (base& b) { b.show(); }

int main(void)
{
	base b;
	derived d;
	print (b);
	print (d);
	return 0;
}
 Output: In base 
In derived
