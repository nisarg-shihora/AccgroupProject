The difference between both save options is that the Export options export the file in a specific format and the Save Project option saves the works in the current position. Later, we can start editing from the point where we have left the editing. Now, we have recorded our first audio using Audacity. The major issue with the recordings is the noise. Most of the microphone recordings contain noise. We may have issues with our main audio. Don't worry; the Audacity is one of the finest tools to remove the noise from the audios. Let's understand how to remove noise from our recordings. How to Remove Noise Using Audacity The Audacity supports a built-in plug-in for noise reduction.

The difference between both save options is that the Export options export the file in a specific format and the Save Project option saves the works in the current position. Later, we can start editing from the point where we have left the editing. Now, we have recorded our first audio using Audacity. The major issue with the recordings is the noise. Most of the microphone recordings contain noise. We may have issues with our main audio. Don't worry; the Audacity is one of the finest tools to remove the noise from the audios. Let's understand how to remove noise from our recordings. How to Remove Noise Using Audacity The Audacity supports a built-in plug-in for noise reduction.

The difference between both save options is that the Export options export the file in a specific format and the Save Project option saves the works in the current position. Later, we can start editing from the point where we have left the editing. Now, we have recorded our first audio using Audacity. The major issue with the recordings is the noise. Most of the microphone recordings contain noise. We may have issues with our main audio. Don't worry; the Audacity is one of the finest tools to remove the noise from the audios.
