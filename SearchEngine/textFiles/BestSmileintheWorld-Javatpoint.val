For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression? Let's save this thought for another time. Talking about smiles, it can be a genuine and spontaneous reaction or a well-thought-of, conscious, and intentional response to something. Whichever one it is, it always proves beneficial for the health of the body. Here are a few reasons that will definitely motivate you to smile more often- 1. Smiling Helps You Live Longer Yes! It's true. A study conducted in 2010 showed that genuine, passionate smiling is linked to a longer and healthier life. Smiling can help you enhance your longevity. Happier people are said to enjoy longer life spans and better health; however, it is necessary to discover why that's the case. 2. Smiling Relieves Stress Stress can be a part of our body and manifest in our appearance. Smiles can help us avoid looking exhausted, worn out and stressed. It can actually lessen stress through the release of endorphins. 3. Smiling Elevates Mood If you're feeling down, you can try to put on a smile. The smile actually triggers neural pathways in your brain that affect your mood. This means that by wearing a happy smile, you will "trick" your mind into being in a state of joy. No matter if you actually don't feel like smiling. By smiling, it's likely that your mood will shift for the better, even if you were a little upset. Smiles can improve your neural communication. This they do by stimulating an increase in neuropeptides. They also help in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which boost your mood. Consider smiling as an antidepressant that is natural. 4. Smiles increase Your Immune System.

Smiling Makes You Attractive We naturally gravitate towards those who smile.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression? Let's save this thought for another time. Talking about smiles, it can be a genuine and spontaneous reaction or a well-thought-of, conscious, and intentional response to something. Whichever one it is, it always proves beneficial for the health of the body. Here are a few reasons that will definitely motivate you to smile more often- 1. Smiling Helps You Live Longer Yes! It's true. A study conducted in 2010 showed that genuine, passionate smiling is linked to a longer and healthier life. Smiling can help you enhance your longevity. Happier people are said to enjoy longer life spans and better health; however, it is necessary to discover why that's the case. 2. Smiling Relieves Stress Stress can be a part of our body and manifest in our appearance. Smiles can help us avoid looking exhausted, worn out and stressed. It can actually lessen stress through the release of endorphins. 3. Smiling Elevates Mood If you're feeling down, you can try to put on a smile. The smile actually triggers neural pathways in your brain that affect your mood. This means that by wearing a happy smile, you will "trick" your mind into being in a state of joy. No matter if you actually don't feel like smiling. By smiling, it's likely that your mood will shift for the better, even if you were a little upset. Smiles can improve your neural communication. This they do by stimulating an increase in neuropeptides. They also help in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which boost your mood. Consider smiling as an antidepressant that is natural. 4. Smiles increase Your Immune System. Smiles stimulate releases of neurotransmitters which decrease stress levels and trigger feelings of happiness, assisting your immune system to work at its best fighting infections and antigens. Smiling can also increase the number of antibodies and natural killer cells that helps boost the immune system. 5. Smiling Reduces Pain Smiles are a natural painkiller. Research has shown that smiling triggers endorphins which act to relieve pain, and serotonin, which helps in the stabilization of mood. These brain chemicals make us feel great. They do not just boost the mood; they also ease the body and decrease physical discomfort. It is a natural way to relax. 6. Smiling Makes You Attractive We naturally gravitate towards those who smile. In contrast, more severe facial expressions, such as frowns, scowls and contrary grimaces, are effective in disorienting people. Whereas Smiles are perceived as attractive. People may even think you possess positive traits when you're smiling, similar to the Halo effect. Smiles can not only make you appear more attractive; they can help you appear younger. The muscles we use when we smile can elevate the appearance of the face, which makes one appear younger. Therefore, instead of opting for facelifts, smile throughout your day. You'll appear more youthful as well feel healthier. When we talk about smiles, how can we not mention Mona Lisa, who is believed to have had the most mysterious, ambiguous, yet very beautiful smile.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression? Let's save this thought for another time. Talking about smiles, it can be a genuine and spontaneous reaction or a well-thought-of, conscious, and intentional response to something. Whichever one it is, it always proves beneficial for the health of the body. Here are a few reasons that will definitely motivate you to smile more often- 1. Smiling Helps You Live Longer Yes!

It is unaffected by prejudice. No matter what your background is, what your geographical surroundings are or what your culture is, your smile will be admired.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression? Let's save this thought for another time. Talking about smiles, it can be a genuine and spontaneous reaction or a well-thought-of, conscious, and intentional response to something. Whichever one it is, it always proves beneficial for the health of the body. Here are a few reasons that will definitely motivate you to smile more often- 1. Smiling Helps You Live Longer Yes!

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression? Let's save this thought for another time. Talking about smiles, it can be a genuine and spontaneous reaction or a well-thought-of, conscious, and intentional response to something.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression?

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression?

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give.

Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression?

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give.

For that matter, a smile is the best makeup any person could wear. Since childhood, we are taught to start our day with a smile on our faces. A smile can brighten up your dull day. Aaliah Dhorat, a writer from West Yorkshire, has described a smile as infectious and compared it to a virus that can spread from one person to the other. 'Someone smiled at me today, and so I started smiling too'. It is almost like flu. But, good flu, that should outspread more often. Did you ever come across the fact that smiling can trigger the brain's reward mechanisms in a way that even chocolate, a highly-regarded pleasure-giver, cannot compete with? Another intriguing fact is that a recent study found that smiling can be just as stimulating as receiving around 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash. Hence it is possible that those who smile around every day for 62 minutes are likely to feel like millionaires! Smiling is a natural phenomenon that you don't have to learn. Humans are pre-programmed to smile when they feel pleasant. Evidence for this is that the people who are blind from birth, who have never really seen a smile, in reality, tend to give the same smiling response as someone with perfectly healthy eyesight would give. Isn't it surprising that we all have this precious God-given gift of Smiling that can make us feel good any time of the day, yet the world is witnessing an increase in mental health issues like anxiety and depression? Let's save this thought for another time. Talking about smiles, it can be a genuine and spontaneous reaction or a well-thought-of, conscious, and intentional response to something. Whichever one it is, it always proves beneficial for the health of the body. Here are a few reasons that will definitely motivate you to smile more often- 1. Smiling Helps You Live Longer Yes! It's true. A study conducted in 2010 showed that genuine, passionate smiling is linked to a longer and healthier life. Smiling can help you enhance your longevity. Happier people are said to enjoy longer life spans and better health; however, it is necessary to discover why that's the case. 2. Smiling Relieves Stress Stress can be a part of our body and manifest in our appearance. Smiles can help us avoid looking exhausted, worn out and stressed. It can actually lessen stress through the release of endorphins. 3. Smiling Elevates Mood If you're feeling down, you can try to put on a smile. The smile actually triggers neural pathways in your brain that affect your mood. This means that by wearing a happy smile, you will "trick" your mind into being in a state of joy. No matter if you actually don't feel like smiling. By smiling, it's likely that your mood will shift for the better, even if you were a little upset. Smiles can improve your neural communication. This they do by stimulating an increase in neuropeptides. They also help in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which boost your mood. Consider smiling as an antidepressant that is natural. 4. Smiles increase Your Immune System. Smiles stimulate releases of neurotransmitters which decrease stress levels and trigger feelings of happiness, assisting your immune system to work at its best fighting infections and antigens. Smiling can also increase the number of antibodies and natural killer cells that helps boost the immune system. 5. Smiling Reduces Pain Smiles are a natural painkiller. Research has shown that smiling triggers endorphins which act to relieve pain, and serotonin, which helps in the stabilization of mood. These brain chemicals make us feel great. They do not just boost the mood; they also ease the body and decrease physical discomfort. It is a natural way to relax. 6. Smiling Makes You Attractive We naturally gravitate towards those who smile. In contrast, more severe facial expressions, such as frowns, scowls and contrary grimaces, are effective in disorienting people. Whereas Smiles are perceived as attractive. People may even think you possess positive traits when you're smiling, similar to the Halo effect. Smiles can not only make you appear more attractive; they can help you appear younger. The muscles we use when we smile can elevate the appearance of the face, which makes one appear younger. Therefore, instead of opting for facelifts, smile throughout your day. You'll appear more youthful as well feel healthier. When we talk about smiles, how can we not mention Mona Lisa, who is believed to have had the most mysterious, ambiguous, yet very beautiful smile. While Mona Lisa was Da Vinci's imagination, some people are 100 per cent living and alive and have the prettiest of smiles. Let's have a look at them- 1.
