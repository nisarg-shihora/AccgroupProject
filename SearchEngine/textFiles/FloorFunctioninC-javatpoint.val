The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.

The floor() function takes a value from the user and returns the double value that is less than or equal to the value of x. Syntax for using floor() The function's return type is double, which takes a numerical argument. It can also be int, float, or any other datatype that can hold numerical value. Thus, the syntax is as follows: 
double floor(double arg);
 Implementing floor() in a C Program Below is the code for implementing the floor() function in C language: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main () {
// initializing the variables in the program
// here we have taken five floating pt numbers
float realno1, realno2, realno3, realno4, realno5, realno6;
float answer, answer1;
// assigning values to the initialized variables
realno1 = 3.1;
realno2 = 9.8;
realno3 = 11.9;
realno4 = 12.1;
realno5 = 16.5;
realno6 = 11.1;
//Computing and printing the floor value of the integers
printf("floor value of realno1 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno1));
printf("floor value of realno2 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno2));
printf("floor value of realno3 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno3));
printf("floor value of realno4 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno4));
printf("floor value of realno5 is = %.1lf\n", floor(realno5));
//You can either directly call the floor() function in the print statement
// or you can use it as any other function and call it outside the print and store the result in other variable
answer = floor(realno6);
printf("floor value of realno6 is = %.1f\n", answer);
//You can directly use a numerical value too
answer1 = floor(9.99);
printf("floor value of value is = %.1f\n", answer1);
return(0);
}
 Output: Explanation: We have used the function in three different ways in the above program. We have first directly printed the floor value using the printf() statement without storing the computed value in any variable. In the second method we have storing the value computed using the variable floor. Then we used the value stored in the variable to print the output. In the last method, we have directly used a numerical value as the input parameter in the function and have stored the value in the variable, which is to be printed.
