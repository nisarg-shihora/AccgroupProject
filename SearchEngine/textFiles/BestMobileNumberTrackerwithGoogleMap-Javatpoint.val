It may also need The Location and Find My Device services. You can use the app "Find My Device" directly, or with the help of the internet, you can track your phone by following these steps. First of all, Open com/find in the browser and then sign in to your device's Google Account. If you are using various devices with the same account, you need to choose which phone you are trying to track.

Now you have access to lock your device, or you can erase the data of the mobile but always remember, removing data will automatically remove the Google account, and your device will not be accessible from Find my device anymore. This service is good for someone who recently lost their phone and can help the user to save their data from stealing or misusing.

These are three simple ways to track any device without using third-party apps. Google Maps App Maybe you are unaware, but Google Maps itself can easily identify where the user is and the location and further information about a mobile phone. For this technique to work exactly, the location services characteristic must be allowed, and also the phone should be switched on. If you want to trace the mobile by Google Maps: Open the Google Maps app on the device you want to track. Start your account by selecting the icon on the upper right side of the window. Choose 'Add another Account' from the catalogue of alternatives. Select Google Accounts and sign in by the email address of the related person which phone you desire to trace.

Find My Device This feature is one of the best ways to find your phone and erase your important data when you lose the phone. I know this may not sound like you are so unpleasant, but your data can be used against you, and this is why it is important to erase data from the phone. But one most important thing to notice is that you can only use this feature when your phone is switched on with active internet and your Google account signed in (which mostly is important for browsing) in the device you are tracking.

Google map provides you service to track any phone number's location, but you need a third-party app for this. So how to track numbers with Google Maps and which are the best apps for this service are given below. How to track a mobile number on Google Maps? These are three simple ways to track any device without using third-party apps. Google Maps App Maybe you are unaware, but Google Maps itself can easily identify where the user is and the location and further information about a mobile phone.

Choose 'Add another Account' from the catalogue of alternatives. Select Google Accounts and sign in by the email address of the related person which phone you desire to trace.

Now you have access to lock your device, or you can erase the data of the mobile but always remember, removing data will automatically remove the Google account, and your device will not be accessible from Find my device anymore. This service is good for someone who recently lost their phone and can help the user to save their data from stealing or misusing.

Or if your favourite person leaves the house without informing you where they are going? You can track your mobile's location with the help of Google Maps. Probably you won't be aware of these apps. Google map provides you service to track any phone number's location, but you need a third-party app for this. So how to track numbers with Google Maps and which are the best apps for this service are given below. How to track a mobile number on Google Maps? These are three simple ways to track any device without using third-party apps. Google Maps App Maybe you are unaware, but Google Maps itself can easily identify where the user is and the location and further information about a mobile phone. For this technique to work exactly, the location services characteristic must be allowed, and also the phone should be switched on. If you want to trace the mobile by Google Maps: Open the Google Maps app on the device you want to track. Start your account by selecting the icon on the upper right side of the window. Choose 'Add another Account' from the catalogue of alternatives. Select Google Accounts and sign in by the email address of the related person which phone you desire to trace.

Find My Device This feature is one of the best ways to find your phone and erase your important data when you lose the phone. I know this may not sound like you are so unpleasant, but your data can be used against you, and this is why it is important to erase data from the phone. But one most important thing to notice is that you can only use this feature when your phone is switched on with active internet and your Google account signed in (which mostly is important for browsing) in the device you are tracking. It may also need The Location and Find My Device services. You can use the app "Find My Device" directly, or with the help of the internet, you can track your phone by following these steps. First of all, Open com/find in the browser and then sign in to your device's Google Account. If you are using various devices with the same account, you need to choose which phone you are trying to track.

Now you have access to lock your device, or you can erase the data of the mobile but always remember, removing data will automatically remove the Google account, and your device will not be accessible from Find my device anymore. This service is good for someone who recently lost their phone and can help the user to save their data from stealing or misusing. Location Sharing This is the easiest and most wonderful way to know where your loved ones are (of course, with their permission or knowledge). You can easily track anyone's phone by opening the "Location Sharing" in Google Maps. How? These are the steps. First of all, you need to start the app on the person's phone you want to track and know you have to smack the 'Hamburger' icon (Given on the top left), or in other versions of the app, you can click profile given on the right side. Now choose the 'Location Sharing' choice from the menu list. You can press 'Get Started' when the pop-up becomes visible on the screen.

You have to select the Contact which you want to text. Always remember it will ask for permission through a dialogue box where you have to click Ok. In the end, you have to click on 'Send' and will get the link on the other number and track the phone with the help of Google maps.

Or if your favourite person leaves the house without informing you where they are going? You can track your mobile's location with the help of Google Maps. Probably you won't be aware of these apps. Google map provides you service to track any phone number's location, but you need a third-party app for this. So how to track numbers with Google Maps and which are the best apps for this service are given below. How to track a mobile number on Google Maps? These are three simple ways to track any device without using third-party apps. Google Maps App Maybe you are unaware, but Google Maps itself can easily identify where the user is and the location and further information about a mobile phone. For this technique to work exactly, the location services characteristic must be allowed, and also the phone should be switched on. If you want to trace the mobile by Google Maps: Open the Google Maps app on the device you want to track. Start your account by selecting the icon on the upper right side of the window. Choose 'Add another Account' from the catalogue of alternatives. Select Google Accounts and sign in by the email address of the related person which phone you desire to trace.

Find My Device This feature is one of the best ways to find your phone and erase your important data when you lose the phone. I know this may not sound like you are so unpleasant, but your data can be used against you, and this is why it is important to erase data from the phone. But one most important thing to notice is that you can only use this feature when your phone is switched on with active internet and your Google account signed in (which mostly is important for browsing) in the device you are tracking. It may also need The Location and Find My Device services. You can use the app "Find My Device" directly, or with the help of the internet, you can track your phone by following these steps. First of all, Open com/find in the browser and then sign in to your device's Google Account. If you are using various devices with the same account, you need to choose which phone you are trying to track.

Now you have access to lock your device, or you can erase the data of the mobile but always remember, removing data will automatically remove the Google account, and your device will not be accessible from Find my device anymore. This service is good for someone who recently lost their phone and can help the user to save their data from stealing or misusing. Location Sharing This is the easiest and most wonderful way to know where your loved ones are (of course, with their permission or knowledge). You can easily track anyone's phone by opening the "Location Sharing" in Google Maps. How? These are the steps.
