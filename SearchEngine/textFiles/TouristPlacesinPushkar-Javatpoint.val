For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1.

Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills.

For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

One of India's oldest cities in Pushkar. Thousands of visitors and worshippers go to Rajasthan each year, and Pushkar, a beautiful city northwest of Ajmer, is a famous destination. Five hundred ten meters of hills encircle Pushkar on three sides. The "Nag Pahar," or Snake Mountain, naturally separates Ajmer and Pushkar. The famous Pushkar rose, sometimes referred to as "the rose garden of Rajasthan," is sold worldwide. Pushkar is a fascinating city with a rich mythological history and timeless architectural legacy. According to tradition, a lake was instantly created when Lord Brahma, believed to be the universe's creator, dropped a lotus on the earth. In honour of the lotus, he then chose the name Pushkar for the place. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple in the entire globe devoted to Lord Brahma. For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

Pushkar is home to more than 500 temples, many of which are quite old, but the Brahma temple is the most prominent one. After coming to earth to carry out a yajna, according to mythology, Brahma built his temple here. Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara renovated the temple in the eighth century. However, Maharaja Jawat Raj of Ratlam is credited with repairing and making minor modifications to the existing structure. The Lord Brahma and Gayatri, his second wife, are honoured in the temple's. Marble and stone stabs are used to construct the temple. The temple has a striking hamsa (bird) theme, and its scarlet pinnacle (shikhara) may be spotted from a distance.

One of India's oldest cities in Pushkar. Thousands of visitors and worshippers go to Rajasthan each year, and Pushkar, a beautiful city northwest of Ajmer, is a famous destination.

The famous Pushkar rose, sometimes referred to as "the rose garden of Rajasthan," is sold worldwide. Pushkar is a fascinating city with a rich mythological history and timeless architectural legacy. According to tradition, a lake was instantly created when Lord Brahma, believed to be the universe's creator, dropped a lotus on the earth. In honour of the lotus, he then chose the name Pushkar for the place. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple in the entire globe devoted to Lord Brahma. For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

After coming to earth to carry out a yajna, according to mythology, Brahma built his temple here. Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara renovated the temple in the eighth century. However, Maharaja Jawat Raj of Ratlam is credited with repairing and making minor modifications to the existing structure. The Lord Brahma and Gayatri, his second wife, are honoured in the temple's. Marble and stone stabs are used to construct the temple. The temple has a striking hamsa (bird) theme, and its scarlet pinnacle (shikhara) may be spotted from a distance.

Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills.

The famous Pushkar rose, sometimes referred to as "the rose garden of Rajasthan," is sold worldwide. Pushkar is a fascinating city with a rich mythological history and timeless architectural legacy. According to tradition, a lake was instantly created when Lord Brahma, believed to be the universe's creator, dropped a lotus on the earth. In honour of the lotus, he then chose the name Pushkar for the place. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple in the entire globe devoted to Lord Brahma. For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

Pushkar is home to more than 500 temples, many of which are quite old, but the Brahma temple is the most prominent one. After coming to earth to carry out a yajna, according to mythology, Brahma built his temple here. Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara renovated the temple in the eighth century. However, Maharaja Jawat Raj of Ratlam is credited with repairing and making minor modifications to the existing structure. The Lord Brahma and Gayatri, his second wife, are honoured in the temple's. Marble and stone stabs are used to construct the temple. The temple has a striking hamsa (bird) theme, and its scarlet pinnacle (shikhara) may be spotted from a distance.

One of India's oldest cities in Pushkar. Thousands of visitors and worshippers go to Rajasthan each year, and Pushkar, a beautiful city northwest of Ajmer, is a famous destination. Five hundred ten meters of hills encircle Pushkar on three sides. The "Nag Pahar," or Snake Mountain, naturally separates Ajmer and Pushkar. The famous Pushkar rose, sometimes referred to as "the rose garden of Rajasthan," is sold worldwide. Pushkar is a fascinating city with a rich mythological history and timeless architectural legacy. According to tradition, a lake was instantly created when Lord Brahma, believed to be the universe's creator, dropped a lotus on the earth. In honour of the lotus, he then chose the name Pushkar for the place. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple in the entire globe devoted to Lord Brahma. For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

One of India's oldest cities in Pushkar. Thousands of visitors and worshippers go to Rajasthan each year, and Pushkar, a beautiful city northwest of Ajmer, is a famous destination.

The famous Pushkar rose, sometimes referred to as "the rose garden of Rajasthan," is sold worldwide. Pushkar is a fascinating city with a rich mythological history and timeless architectural legacy. According to tradition, a lake was instantly created when Lord Brahma, believed to be the universe's creator, dropped a lotus on the earth. In honour of the lotus, he then chose the name Pushkar for the place. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple in the entire globe devoted to Lord Brahma. For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

After coming to earth to carry out a yajna, according to mythology, Brahma built his temple here. Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara renovated the temple in the eighth century. However, Maharaja Jawat Raj of Ratlam is credited with repairing and making minor modifications to the existing structure. The Lord Brahma and Gayatri, his second wife, are honoured in the temple's. Marble and stone stabs are used to construct the temple. The temple has a striking hamsa (bird) theme, and its scarlet pinnacle (shikhara) may be spotted from a distance.

Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills.

The famous Pushkar rose, sometimes referred to as "the rose garden of Rajasthan," is sold worldwide. Pushkar is a fascinating city with a rich mythological history and timeless architectural legacy. According to tradition, a lake was instantly created when Lord Brahma, believed to be the universe's creator, dropped a lotus on the earth. In honour of the lotus, he then chose the name Pushkar for the place. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple in the entire globe devoted to Lord Brahma. For Hindus, visiting Pushkar is the greatest achievement of pilgrimages that one must do to find salvation. 1. Pushkar Lake: Pushkar Lake is said to be as old as creation itself because of the legend that it was created when a lotus fell from the hands of Lord Brahma, the creator deity. Hindu mythology describes the five lakes: Man Sarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar, and Pushkar Sarovar. The holiest of all of them is believed to be Pushkar Lake. Devotees believe that bathing in the lake on Kartik Poornima (during the Pushkar Fair) will atone for sins and cure all skin problems. This artificial lake was created by building a dam hidden away in the Aravalli range, surrounded by a desert and hills. The lake contains 52 bathing ghats (steps that go into the water), and it is said that the water at each ghat has unique healing potential. Over 500 temples may be seen along the shores of Pushkar Lake, indicating that it is a well-liked pilgrimage site. The Ways to Get here: Buses depart from Ajmer station every hour.

Pushkar is home to more than 500 temples, many of which are quite old, but the Brahma temple is the most prominent one. After coming to earth to carry out a yajna, according to mythology, Brahma built his temple here. Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara renovated the temple in the eighth century. However, Maharaja Jawat Raj of Ratlam is credited with repairing and making minor modifications to the existing structure. The Lord Brahma and Gayatri, his second wife, are honoured in the temple's. Marble and stone stabs are used to construct the temple. The temple has a striking hamsa (bird) theme, and its scarlet pinnacle (shikhara) may be spotted from a distance.
