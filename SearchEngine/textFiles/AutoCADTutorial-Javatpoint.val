It has also increased the speed of manufacturing of the parts. What is AutoCAD? AutoCAD stands for Autodesk Computer-Aided Design. It is a drafting and design software application developed and marketed by Autodesk. The AutoCAD software is used in industries, by architects, designers, graphic designers, city planners, managers, and other professionals worldwide. The commercial CAD programs were used before the development of AutoCAD. The AutoCAD was run on microcomputers with an internal graphics controller. The commercial CAD programs ran on the minicomputers or mainframe computers, where each CAD operator worked at a separate graphics terminal. The AutoCAD software is available in various languages, namely, English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Spanish, Albanian, Polish, Russian, Czech, Hungarian, Chinese Simplified and Traditional, and Brazilian Portuguese. The AutoCAD has developed for various programs and fields. Features of AutoCAD The features of AutoCAD are listed below: 3D navigation Visual styles 3D scanning and point clouds Data extraction Section planes Data linking Layouts Tool palettes Express tools Fields Dynamic blocks Command lines Import 3D models User interaction Multifunctional Grips Revision clouds Image references Tables Solid, surface and Mesh modeling Photorealistic rendering Section and Projected views PDF Import and Export Panels Ribbon tabs Isometric view AutoCAD Mobile App Collaboration Parametric constraints 3D Scanning Point clouds Products of AutoCAD Free trials 3D CAD Software 3D Animation 3D Modelling Software 2D CAD Drafting 3D Printing Civil Engineering Construction (US site) Manufacturing (US site) Sketching and Painting Product Design Find by Industry History of AutoCAD The Interact CAD was the first program began in 1977 and released in 1979.
