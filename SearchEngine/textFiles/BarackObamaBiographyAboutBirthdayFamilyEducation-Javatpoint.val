On the date 11th March, 2009, for all the girls and ladies, Barack Obama made a council in the White House. It was organized as a major part of intergovernmental relations for suggestions or advice on the great concern over the well-being of all women and girls. Legacy Obama's most outstanding or notable achievement is widely regarded as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the portions of which entered into force from 2010 through 2020.

On October 24, 2018, the Secret Service seized a pipe bomb intended for President Obama. It was one of the numerous pipe bombs sent to Democratic legislators and leaders earlier.

In March 2009, Obama stepped into the struggling automobile sector, providing loans to General Motors and Chrysler to allow them to maintain operations while restructuring.

Iraqi War Obama said on February 27, 2009, that combat missions in Iraq would stop in 18 months. The Obama administration planned to remove combat forces by August 2010, reducing the number of troops from 142,000 but leaving a provisional force of around 50,000 in Iraq till the end of 2011. Afghanistan's War In February 2009, Obama reported an expansion in U.S. force ranks to 17,000 army personnel to regulate a slow decline in Afghanistan.

On May 10, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Elena Kagan to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010. As a result, for the first time in entire American history, the number of women (i.e., 3) was the highest on the Court. On the date 11th March, 2009, for all the girls and ladies, Barack Obama made a council in the White House. It was organized as a major part of intergovernmental relations for suggestions or advice on the great concern over the well-being of all women and girls. Legacy Obama's most outstanding or notable achievement is widely regarded as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the portions of which entered into force from 2010 through 2020. Several Republican Senators' efforts to implement the ACA, along with a "skinny repeal," have so far been unsuccessful. Several observers applaud Obama for preventing distress and bringing economic growth out of the Great Recession.

Obama advocated for LGBT rights when he was President. In 2010, President signed a Don't Ask, Don't Tell Amendment Act, which repealed the "don't ask, don't tell" rule in the United States military services, which prohibited public service for LGB individuals; the law took effect the following year. His government lifted the prohibition on transgender persons serving openly in the United States military forces in 2016.

In May 2018, Obama condemned Donald Trump's decision to pull from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, claiming that the agreement was functioning in the Country's best interests. On October 24, 2018, the Secret Service seized a pipe bomb intended for President Obama. It was one of the numerous pipe bombs sent to Democratic legislators and leaders earlier.

In March 2009, Obama stepped into the struggling automobile sector, providing loans to General Motors and Chrysler to allow them to maintain operations while restructuring.

He approved the Car Allowance Rebate System, called Cash for Clunkers, into policy, which briefly helped the economy. The unemployment (or jobless) rate increased in 2009, peaking at 10.0 % in October and an average of 10.0% in the fourth quarter.

Iraqi War Obama said on February 27, 2009, that combat missions in Iraq would stop in 18 months. The Obama administration planned to remove combat forces by August 2010, reducing the number of troops from 142,000 but leaving a provisional force of around 50,000 in Iraq till the end of 2011.

He is a politician of America, where he worked as the 44th United States of America on 2009 and completed his presidency on 2017. Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962. Education When Barack was six years old, Barack and his mom flew to Indonesia to visit his stepfather. As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992. Despite being former President, Obama has also been a Chicago White Sox fan who tossed out the first ball in the 2005 ALCS as a senator. In 2009, he gave out the opening pitch at the All-Star Match while wearing a White Sox jacket. The Obamas relocated out of a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million property in adjacent Kenwood, Chicago, in 2005, using the earnings of a book contract. From 1993 till 1996, he had been an associate with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney firm specializing in civil rights and neighborhood industrial progress. From 1996 to 2004, he has been of council member. Obama was on the company boards of the Woods Sponsor of Chicago, the very first organization to help finance the Building Communities Project in 1985, and the Joyce Foundation from 1994 to 2002. Illinois Senate Obama was selected for the Illinois Senate (upper chamber of the Illinois General Assembly) in 1996, replacing Republican State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois' 13th district, which included Hyde Park-Kenwood, South Shore, and Chicago Lawn areas. In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004. Alan Keyes (an American politician) confirmed the Party's new nominations to start replacing Ryan six weeks later. U.S. Senate On January 3, 2005, Obama was sworn in as the President's only representative from the Congressional Black Caucus in the United States Senate. He was responsible for two projects that bear his name: Lugar-Obama, which extended the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Management idea to conventional weapons, and the Public Funding Responsibility and Clarity Act of 2006, which authorized the creation of USAspending.gov, an internet search engine for federal spending. In December 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer.

The whole Senate approved this amendment in the spring of 2008. Barack traveled or visited Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa as a senator Foreign Affairs Committee.

Campaigns for the Presidency On February 10, 2007, Barack launched his candidacy for President of his Country (USA) in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The site of the proclamation was significant since it was the place of Abraham Lincoln's historic "House Divided" statement in 1858. President announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running partner on August 23, 2008. Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine. Obama made his commencement address to a gathering of around 84 thousand persons at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium; nearly 3 million citizens saw him. Obama's initiative broke multiple crowdfunding records, notably in the number of small contributions, throughout the primary and general elections. On April 4, 2011, he filed political registration with the Electoral Commission and launched his 2012 new election effort with a segment called "It Begins with Us," which he uploaded on his website. He ran largely uncontested in the Democratic Party presidential primaries as the incoming President, and on April 3, 2012, Obama earned the 2778 convention delegates required to clinch the Democratic candidacy. On November 6, 2012, Obama got 332 delegate votes, which was more than the 270 required for re-election. He then became the first Republican President after Franklin D.

Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962. Education When Barack was six years old, Barack and his mom flew to Indonesia to visit his stepfather. As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992. Despite being former President, Obama has also been a Chicago White Sox fan who tossed out the first ball in the 2005 ALCS as a senator. In 2009, he gave out the opening pitch at the All-Star Match while wearing a White Sox jacket. The Obamas relocated out of a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million property in adjacent Kenwood, Chicago, in 2005, using the earnings of a book contract. From 1993 till 1996, he had been an associate with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney firm specializing in civil rights and neighborhood industrial progress. From 1996 to 2004, he has been of council member. Obama was on the company boards of the Woods Sponsor of Chicago, the very first organization to help finance the Building Communities Project in 1985, and the Joyce Foundation from 1994 to 2002. Illinois Senate Obama was selected for the Illinois Senate (upper chamber of the Illinois General Assembly) in 1996, replacing Republican State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois' 13th district, which included Hyde Park-Kenwood, South Shore, and Chicago Lawn areas. In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004. Alan Keyes (an American politician) confirmed the Party's new nominations to start replacing Ryan six weeks later. U.S. Senate On January 3, 2005, Obama was sworn in as the President's only representative from the Congressional Black Caucus in the United States Senate. He was responsible for two projects that bear his name: Lugar-Obama, which extended the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Management idea to conventional weapons, and the Public Funding Responsibility and Clarity Act of 2006, which authorized the creation of USAspending.gov, an internet search engine for federal spending. In December 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer. Later that year, Obama introduced legislation to the Defence Authorization Act to include protections for army discharges due to personality disorders. The whole Senate approved this amendment in the spring of 2008. Barack traveled or visited Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa as a senator Foreign Affairs Committee. He visited there with Mahmoud Abbas before he became the leader of the Palestinian National Authority. Campaigns for the Presidency On February 10, 2007, Barack launched his candidacy for President of his Country (USA) in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The site of the proclamation was significant since it was the place of Abraham Lincoln's historic "House Divided" statement in 1858. President announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running partner on August 23, 2008. Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine. Obama made his commencement address to a gathering of around 84 thousand persons at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium; nearly 3 million citizens saw him. Obama's initiative broke multiple crowdfunding records, notably in the number of small contributions, throughout the primary and general elections. On April 4, 2011, he filed political registration with the Electoral Commission and launched his 2012 new election effort with a segment called "It Begins with Us," which he uploaded on his website. He ran largely uncontested in the Democratic Party presidential primaries as the incoming President, and on April 3, 2012, Obama earned the 2778 convention delegates required to clinch the Democratic candidacy. On November 6, 2012, Obama got 332 delegate votes, which was more than the 270 required for re-election. He then became the first Republican President after Franklin D. Roosevelt to get more than half of the votes, with 51.1 percent of the popular vote. Barack Obama as President Barack Obama won as the 44th President of the USA on January 20, 2009.

He likewise reversed President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City rules, who limited federal support for overseas family planning organizations that undertake or give abortion counseling. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Obama's inaugural action, reduced the statute of limitations for equivalent claims. In March 2009, he reversed a Bush-era law that prohibited funding for embryos and vowed to set strict standards for the study. He appointed two women to the Supreme Court during his first two terms in office. Sonia Sotomayor was appointed to replace departing Chief Judge David Souter on May 26, 2009. On August 6, 2009, she was appointed the first Supreme Court Judge of Hispanic heritage. On May 10, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Elena Kagan to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010. As a result, for the first time in entire American history, the number of women (i.e., 3) was the highest on the Court. On the date 11th March, 2009, for all the girls and ladies, Barack Obama made a council in the White House. It was organized as a major part of intergovernmental relations for suggestions or advice on the great concern over the well-being of all women and girls. Legacy Obama's most outstanding or notable achievement is widely regarded as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the portions of which entered into force from 2010 through 2020. Several Republican Senators' efforts to implement the ACA, along with a "skinny repeal," have so far been unsuccessful. Several observers applaud Obama for preventing distress and bringing economic growth out of the Great Recession. As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from the month following his 1st launching to the conclusion of his time, the Obama administration produced around 11.3 million new jobs. Obama advocated for LGBT rights when he was President. In 2010, President signed a Don't Ask, Don't Tell Amendment Act, which repealed the "don't ask, don't tell" rule in the United States military services, which prohibited public service for LGB individuals; the law took effect the following year. His government lifted the prohibition on transgender persons serving openly in the United States military forces in 2016. Obama has increased more use of drone attacks targeting accused al-Qaeda and Taliban members and terrorists. In 2016, his final year in office, the United States unleashed 26,171 explosives on 7 different nations. According to the Pew Research Center and the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, prisoners placed in U.S. federal detention decreased by 5% between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2015. It has become the most considerable decrease in sentenced convicts in federal detention in the United States after Republican President Jimmy Carter. According to Julian Zelizer's book The Administration of Barack Obama, the Democratic dropped nearly 1000 slots in state legislatures, governorships, and Congress throughout Obama's presidency. After Presidency Obama's administration ended with the arrival of his successor, Donald Trump, on January 20, 2017. Later, Obama left the White House with his family and is currently living in Kalorama, Washington, D.C. On June 1, Trump stated the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Contract, and Obama put out a statement opposing the decision. In May 2018, Obama condemned Donald Trump's decision to pull from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, claiming that the agreement was functioning in the Country's best interests. On October 24, 2018, the Secret Service seized a pipe bomb intended for President Obama. It was one of the numerous pipe bombs sent to Democratic legislators and leaders earlier. On April 14, 2020, Obama backed his former vice president, Joe Biden, the expected Democratic contender, for the presidency in the 2020 election, saying that he had all of the attributes that the Country required in a leader at that time. Economic Policy President Obama approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 on February 17, 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package designed to aid the market's return from growing global depression, Increased government expenditure on health care, construction, schooling, tax cuts, bonuses, and direct help to people are all part of the legislation. In March 2009, Obama stepped into the struggling automobile sector, providing loans to General Motors and Chrysler to allow them to maintain operations while restructuring. Unsatisfied with the progress in economic recovery, Obama directed his administration to increase funding in June 2009. He approved the Car Allowance Rebate System, called Cash for Clunkers, into policy, which briefly helped the economy. The unemployment (or jobless) rate increased in 2009, peaking at 10.0 % in October and an average of 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decline to 9.7% in the first 3 months of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 % in the second quarter and stayed there for the remaining of the year. In November 2012, the jobless rate was 7.7 %, while in December 2013, it was 6.7 %. The jobless rate fell dramatically in 2014, falling to 6.3 percent in the first half. GDP was increased by 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009, succeeded by a 5.0 percent gain in the final quarter. Foreign Policy In February - March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Sec. of State Hillary Clinton undertook independent abroad journeys to herald a "new era" in U.S. international ties with Russia and Europe by using the phrases break and reset to imply significant changes from the previous administration's policy. Iraqi War Obama said on February 27, 2009, that combat missions in Iraq would stop in 18 months. The Obama administration planned to remove combat forces by August 2010, reducing the number of troops from 142,000 but leaving a provisional force of around 50,000 in Iraq till the end of 2011. Afghanistan's War In February 2009, Obama reported an expansion in U.S. force ranks to 17,000 army personnel to regulate a slow decline in Afghanistan.

He is a politician of America, where he worked as the 44th United States of America on 2009 and completed his presidency on 2017. Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962. Education When Barack was six years old, Barack and his mom flew to Indonesia to visit his stepfather. As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992.

In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004.

Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer.

Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine.

On May 10, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Elena Kagan to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010.

On the date 11th March, 2009, for all the girls and ladies, Barack Obama made a council in the White House. It was organized as a major part of intergovernmental relations for suggestions or advice on the great concern over the well-being of all women and girls. Legacy Obama's most outstanding or notable achievement is widely regarded as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the portions of which entered into force from 2010 through 2020. Several Republican Senators' efforts to implement the ACA, along with a "skinny repeal," have so far been unsuccessful. Several observers applaud Obama for preventing distress and bringing economic growth out of the Great Recession.

After Presidency Obama's administration ended with the arrival of his successor, Donald Trump, on January 20, 2017. Later, Obama left the White House with his family and is currently living in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.

In May 2018, Obama condemned Donald Trump's decision to pull from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, claiming that the agreement was functioning in the Country's best interests. On October 24, 2018, the Secret Service seized a pipe bomb intended for President Obama. It was one of the numerous pipe bombs sent to Democratic legislators and leaders earlier.

In March 2009, Obama stepped into the struggling automobile sector, providing loans to General Motors and Chrysler to allow them to maintain operations while restructuring. Unsatisfied with the progress in economic recovery, Obama directed his administration to increase funding in June 2009. He approved the Car Allowance Rebate System, called Cash for Clunkers, into policy, which briefly helped the economy.

GDP was increased by 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009, succeeded by a 5.0 percent gain in the final quarter. Foreign Policy In February - March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Sec. of State Hillary Clinton undertook independent abroad journeys to herald a "new era" in U.S. international ties with Russia and Europe by using the phrases break and reset to imply significant changes from the previous administration's policy. Iraqi War Obama said on February 27, 2009, that combat missions in Iraq would stop in 18 months. The Obama administration planned to remove combat forces by August 2010, reducing the number of troops from 142,000 but leaving a provisional force of around 50,000 in Iraq till the end of 2011. Afghanistan's War In February 2009, Obama reported an expansion in U.S. force ranks to 17,000 army personnel to regulate a slow decline in Afghanistan. He claimed he had not obtained the strategic focus, direction, and resources it sorely needed. Next TopicAkshara Singh ? prev next ?

He is a politician of America, where he worked as the 44th United States of America on 2009 and completed his presidency on 2017. Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962.

As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992. Despite being former President, Obama has also been a Chicago White Sox fan who tossed out the first ball in the 2005 ALCS as a senator. In 2009, he gave out the opening pitch at the All-Star Match while wearing a White Sox jacket. The Obamas relocated out of a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million property in adjacent Kenwood, Chicago, in 2005, using the earnings of a book contract. From 1993 till 1996, he had been an associate with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney firm specializing in civil rights and neighborhood industrial progress. From 1996 to 2004, he has been of council member.

Illinois Senate Obama was selected for the Illinois Senate (upper chamber of the Illinois General Assembly) in 1996, replacing Republican State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois' 13th district, which included Hyde Park-Kenwood, South Shore, and Chicago Lawn areas. In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004. Alan Keyes (an American politician) confirmed the Party's new nominations to start replacing Ryan six weeks later. U.S. Senate On January 3, 2005, Obama was sworn in as the President's only representative from the Congressional Black Caucus in the United States Senate. He was responsible for two projects that bear his name: Lugar-Obama, which extended the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Management idea to conventional weapons, and the Public Funding Responsibility and Clarity Act of 2006, which authorized the creation of USAspending.gov, an internet search engine for federal spending. In December 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer.

The whole Senate approved this amendment in the spring of 2008. Barack traveled or visited Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa as a senator Foreign Affairs Committee.

Campaigns for the Presidency On February 10, 2007, Barack launched his candidacy for President of his Country (USA) in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The site of the proclamation was significant since it was the place of Abraham Lincoln's historic "House Divided" statement in 1858. President announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running partner on August 23, 2008. Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine. Obama made his commencement address to a gathering of around 84 thousand persons at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium; nearly 3 million citizens saw him. Obama's initiative broke multiple crowdfunding records, notably in the number of small contributions, throughout the primary and general elections. On April 4, 2011, he filed political registration with the Electoral Commission and launched his 2012 new election effort with a segment called "It Begins with Us," which he uploaded on his website. He ran largely uncontested in the Democratic Party presidential primaries as the incoming President, and on April 3, 2012, Obama earned the 2778 convention delegates required to clinch the Democratic candidacy. On November 6, 2012, Obama got 332 delegate votes, which was more than the 270 required for re-election. He then became the first Republican President after Franklin D.

Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962. Education When Barack was six years old, Barack and his mom flew to Indonesia to visit his stepfather. As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992. Despite being former President, Obama has also been a Chicago White Sox fan who tossed out the first ball in the 2005 ALCS as a senator. In 2009, he gave out the opening pitch at the All-Star Match while wearing a White Sox jacket. The Obamas relocated out of a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million property in adjacent Kenwood, Chicago, in 2005, using the earnings of a book contract. From 1993 till 1996, he had been an associate with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney firm specializing in civil rights and neighborhood industrial progress. From 1996 to 2004, he has been of council member. Obama was on the company boards of the Woods Sponsor of Chicago, the very first organization to help finance the Building Communities Project in 1985, and the Joyce Foundation from 1994 to 2002. Illinois Senate Obama was selected for the Illinois Senate (upper chamber of the Illinois General Assembly) in 1996, replacing Republican State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois' 13th district, which included Hyde Park-Kenwood, South Shore, and Chicago Lawn areas. In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004. Alan Keyes (an American politician) confirmed the Party's new nominations to start replacing Ryan six weeks later. U.S. Senate On January 3, 2005, Obama was sworn in as the President's only representative from the Congressional Black Caucus in the United States Senate. He was responsible for two projects that bear his name: Lugar-Obama, which extended the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Management idea to conventional weapons, and the Public Funding Responsibility and Clarity Act of 2006, which authorized the creation of USAspending.gov, an internet search engine for federal spending. In December 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer. Later that year, Obama introduced legislation to the Defence Authorization Act to include protections for army discharges due to personality disorders. The whole Senate approved this amendment in the spring of 2008. Barack traveled or visited Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa as a senator Foreign Affairs Committee. He visited there with Mahmoud Abbas before he became the leader of the Palestinian National Authority. Campaigns for the Presidency On February 10, 2007, Barack launched his candidacy for President of his Country (USA) in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The site of the proclamation was significant since it was the place of Abraham Lincoln's historic "House Divided" statement in 1858. President announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running partner on August 23, 2008. Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine. Obama made his commencement address to a gathering of around 84 thousand persons at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium; nearly 3 million citizens saw him. Obama's initiative broke multiple crowdfunding records, notably in the number of small contributions, throughout the primary and general elections. On April 4, 2011, he filed political registration with the Electoral Commission and launched his 2012 new election effort with a segment called "It Begins with Us," which he uploaded on his website. He ran largely uncontested in the Democratic Party presidential primaries as the incoming President, and on April 3, 2012, Obama earned the 2778 convention delegates required to clinch the Democratic candidacy. On November 6, 2012, Obama got 332 delegate votes, which was more than the 270 required for re-election. He then became the first Republican President after Franklin D. Roosevelt to get more than half of the votes, with 51.1 percent of the popular vote. Barack Obama as President Barack Obama won as the 44th President of the USA on January 20, 2009.

He likewise reversed President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City rules, who limited federal support for overseas family planning organizations that undertake or give abortion counseling. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Obama's inaugural action, reduced the statute of limitations for equivalent claims. In March 2009, he reversed a Bush-era law that prohibited funding for embryos and vowed to set strict standards for the study. He appointed two women to the Supreme Court during his first two terms in office. Sonia Sotomayor was appointed to replace departing Chief Judge David Souter on May 26, 2009. On August 6, 2009, she was appointed the first Supreme Court Judge of Hispanic heritage. On May 10, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Elena Kagan to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010. As a result, for the first time in entire American history, the number of women (i.e., 3) was the highest on the Court. On the date 11th March, 2009, for all the girls and ladies, Barack Obama made a council in the White House. It was organized as a major part of intergovernmental relations for suggestions or advice on the great concern over the well-being of all women and girls. Legacy Obama's most outstanding or notable achievement is widely regarded as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the portions of which entered into force from 2010 through 2020. Several Republican Senators' efforts to implement the ACA, along with a "skinny repeal," have so far been unsuccessful. Several observers applaud Obama for preventing distress and bringing economic growth out of the Great Recession. As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from the month following his 1st launching to the conclusion of his time, the Obama administration produced around 11.3 million new jobs. Obama advocated for LGBT rights when he was President. In 2010, President signed a Don't Ask, Don't Tell Amendment Act, which repealed the "don't ask, don't tell" rule in the United States military services, which prohibited public service for LGB individuals; the law took effect the following year. His government lifted the prohibition on transgender persons serving openly in the United States military forces in 2016. Obama has increased more use of drone attacks targeting accused al-Qaeda and Taliban members and terrorists. In 2016, his final year in office, the United States unleashed 26,171 explosives on 7 different nations. According to the Pew Research Center and the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, prisoners placed in U.S. federal detention decreased by 5% between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2015. It has become the most considerable decrease in sentenced convicts in federal detention in the United States after Republican President Jimmy Carter. According to Julian Zelizer's book The Administration of Barack Obama, the Democratic dropped nearly 1000 slots in state legislatures, governorships, and Congress throughout Obama's presidency. After Presidency Obama's administration ended with the arrival of his successor, Donald Trump, on January 20, 2017. Later, Obama left the White House with his family and is currently living in Kalorama, Washington, D.C. On June 1, Trump stated the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Contract, and Obama put out a statement opposing the decision. In May 2018, Obama condemned Donald Trump's decision to pull from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, claiming that the agreement was functioning in the Country's best interests. On October 24, 2018, the Secret Service seized a pipe bomb intended for President Obama. It was one of the numerous pipe bombs sent to Democratic legislators and leaders earlier. On April 14, 2020, Obama backed his former vice president, Joe Biden, the expected Democratic contender, for the presidency in the 2020 election, saying that he had all of the attributes that the Country required in a leader at that time. Economic Policy President Obama approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 on February 17, 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package designed to aid the market's return from growing global depression, Increased government expenditure on health care, construction, schooling, tax cuts, bonuses, and direct help to people are all part of the legislation. In March 2009, Obama stepped into the struggling automobile sector, providing loans to General Motors and Chrysler to allow them to maintain operations while restructuring. Unsatisfied with the progress in economic recovery, Obama directed his administration to increase funding in June 2009. He approved the Car Allowance Rebate System, called Cash for Clunkers, into policy, which briefly helped the economy. The unemployment (or jobless) rate increased in 2009, peaking at 10.0 % in October and an average of 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decline to 9.7% in the first 3 months of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 % in the second quarter and stayed there for the remaining of the year. In November 2012, the jobless rate was 7.7 %, while in December 2013, it was 6.7 %. The jobless rate fell dramatically in 2014, falling to 6.3 percent in the first half. GDP was increased by 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009, succeeded by a 5.0 percent gain in the final quarter. Foreign Policy In February - March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Sec. of State Hillary Clinton undertook independent abroad journeys to herald a "new era" in U.S. international ties with Russia and Europe by using the phrases break and reset to imply significant changes from the previous administration's policy. Iraqi War Obama said on February 27, 2009, that combat missions in Iraq would stop in 18 months. The Obama administration planned to remove combat forces by August 2010, reducing the number of troops from 142,000 but leaving a provisional force of around 50,000 in Iraq till the end of 2011. Afghanistan's War In February 2009, Obama reported an expansion in U.S. force ranks to 17,000 army personnel to regulate a slow decline in Afghanistan.

He is a politician of America, where he worked as the 44th United States of America on 2009 and completed his presidency on 2017. Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962. Education When Barack was six years old, Barack and his mom flew to Indonesia to visit his stepfather. As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992.

In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004.

Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer.

Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine.

On May 10, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Elena Kagan to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010.

On the date 11th March, 2009, for all the girls and ladies, Barack Obama made a council in the White House. It was organized as a major part of intergovernmental relations for suggestions or advice on the great concern over the well-being of all women and girls. Legacy Obama's most outstanding or notable achievement is widely regarded as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the portions of which entered into force from 2010 through 2020. Several Republican Senators' efforts to implement the ACA, along with a "skinny repeal," have so far been unsuccessful. Several observers applaud Obama for preventing distress and bringing economic growth out of the Great Recession.

After Presidency Obama's administration ended with the arrival of his successor, Donald Trump, on January 20, 2017. Later, Obama left the White House with his family and is currently living in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.

In May 2018, Obama condemned Donald Trump's decision to pull from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, claiming that the agreement was functioning in the Country's best interests. On October 24, 2018, the Secret Service seized a pipe bomb intended for President Obama. It was one of the numerous pipe bombs sent to Democratic legislators and leaders earlier.

In March 2009, Obama stepped into the struggling automobile sector, providing loans to General Motors and Chrysler to allow them to maintain operations while restructuring. Unsatisfied with the progress in economic recovery, Obama directed his administration to increase funding in June 2009. He approved the Car Allowance Rebate System, called Cash for Clunkers, into policy, which briefly helped the economy.

GDP was increased by 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009, succeeded by a 5.0 percent gain in the final quarter. Foreign Policy In February - March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Sec. of State Hillary Clinton undertook independent abroad journeys to herald a "new era" in U.S. international ties with Russia and Europe by using the phrases break and reset to imply significant changes from the previous administration's policy. Iraqi War Obama said on February 27, 2009, that combat missions in Iraq would stop in 18 months. The Obama administration planned to remove combat forces by August 2010, reducing the number of troops from 142,000 but leaving a provisional force of around 50,000 in Iraq till the end of 2011. Afghanistan's War In February 2009, Obama reported an expansion in U.S. force ranks to 17,000 army personnel to regulate a slow decline in Afghanistan. He claimed he had not obtained the strategic focus, direction, and resources it sorely needed. Next TopicAkshara Singh ? prev next ?

He is a politician of America, where he worked as the 44th United States of America on 2009 and completed his presidency on 2017. Barack Hussein Obama was born in the Hawaiian city of Honolulu.Obama worked like a community activist in Chicago after graduating with a B.A. Degree in 1983. He attended at Harvard Law School in the year 1988, and then in the second year, he became the very first black President of Harvard Law Reviews. Early Life He was born on 4th August, 1961, at the Kapiolani Medical Center of Women and Children in Honolulu. He seems to be the only leader who was born outside the 48 adjoining states. He got his name from his father, Barack Obama Sr., who was a Kenyan economist. His mother, Ann Dunham, was a well-known accomplished American anthropologist. Barack was primarily raised by his mother. According to an Ancestry.com article published in July 2012, Dunham was often related to John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in a Virginia colony during the 17th century. It claimed that John Punch was the twelfth generation grandfather of President Barack Obama. Barack and his mother moved to Seattle's University of Washington in late August 1961, just very few weeks after his delivery, and stayed over a year. At that time, Obama's dad was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics in Hawaii and did graduation in June 1962. Education When Barack was six years old, Barack and his mom flew to Indonesia to visit his stepfather. As from the age of 6 to 10, he attended Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School schooling. Obama moved back to Hawaii in 1971 to reside with his parents, Madelyn (maternal grandmother) and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou Institution, a prominent college preparation school, on a scholarship from 5th grade until he finished school in 1979. His mother spent most of the next 2 decades in Indonesia, divorced Lolo Soetoro Mangunharjo or Mangundikardjo (stepfather) in 1980, and earned a Ph.D. before passing away in Hawaii in 1995 following unsuccessful treatment for ovaries and uterine cancer. College and Job Obama attended Occidental University on a scholarship after completing high school in 1979. In February 1981, Obama delivered his first new public speech, advocating for Oriental to join the disinvestment from South Africa in reaction to that Country's apartheid policies. Obama visited his mother and half-sister Maya in Indonesia in mid-1981 and then spent the next three weeks in Pakistan visiting the families of college classmates. After graduating, Barack worked for Enterprise International Company for almost a year as a financial consultant and composer and three months in 1985 as a project supervisor for the New American Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus. Family and Personal life Obama was raised with his half-sister and has seven additional half-siblings, six of whom are currently living through the family of their Kenyan father. Madelyn Dunham, Obama's Kansas-born grandmother, lived here till her funeral on November 2, 2008, 2 days before his victory as the President. Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while serving as a liberal democrat in Chicago in the 1980s. He asked her for marriage twice, but Jager and her family declined. He later wed to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. Obama met Michelle Robinson while laboring as a summer intern at the Chicago law office named Sidley Austin in June 1989. Robinson was designated as Obama's advisor there at the company for 3 months, as well as she accompanied him at various team social occasions but rejected his early invitations to date. Following summer, they started dating, decided to get married in 1991, and engaged on October 3, 1992. Despite being former President, Obama has also been a Chicago White Sox fan who tossed out the first ball in the 2005 ALCS as a senator. In 2009, he gave out the opening pitch at the All-Star Match while wearing a White Sox jacket. The Obamas relocated out of a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million property in adjacent Kenwood, Chicago, in 2005, using the earnings of a book contract. From 1993 till 1996, he had been an associate with Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney firm specializing in civil rights and neighborhood industrial progress. From 1996 to 2004, he has been of council member. Obama was on the company boards of the Woods Sponsor of Chicago, the very first organization to help finance the Building Communities Project in 1985, and the Joyce Foundation from 1994 to 2002. Illinois Senate Obama was selected for the Illinois Senate (upper chamber of the Illinois General Assembly) in 1996, replacing Republican State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois' 13th district, which included Hyde Park-Kenwood, South Shore, and Chicago Lawn areas. In 1998, Obama was again chosen for the Illinois Senate, and then in 2002, he beat Republican Yesse Yehudah in the central election. Bobby Rush defeated him in the Primary election for Illinois's very first United States congressional district inside the House of Reps in 2000. Senate Campaign in 2004 In May 2002, Barack sponsored a poll to assess his possibilities in the 2004'S U.S. Senate voting. He assembled a campaign worker, started funding, and engaged with political communication guru David Axelrod in August 2002. Obama officially started his campaign in January 2003. He was a vocal opponent of George W. Bush's occupation of Iraq. Barack spoke against conflict at the first major anti-Iraq Conflict march in Chicago on Oct 2, 2002, a day when George W. Bush and Congress approved on a resolution regarding the Iraq War. Obama's intended general-election opponent, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, dropped out in June 2004. Alan Keyes (an American politician) confirmed the Party's new nominations to start replacing Ryan six weeks later. U.S. Senate On January 3, 2005, Obama was sworn in as the President's only representative from the Congressional Black Caucus in the United States Senate. He was responsible for two projects that bear his name: Lugar-Obama, which extended the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Management idea to conventional weapons, and the Public Funding Responsibility and Clarity Act of 2006, which authorized the creation of USAspending.gov, an internet search engine for federal spending. In December 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Constitutional Democracy of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democratic Development Bill into law, bringing it the first federal bill authorized with Obama as the primary backer. Later that year, Obama introduced legislation to the Defence Authorization Act to include protections for army discharges due to personality disorders. The whole Senate approved this amendment in the spring of 2008. Barack traveled or visited Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa as a senator Foreign Affairs Committee.

Campaigns for the Presidency On February 10, 2007, Barack launched his candidacy for President of his Country (USA) in front of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The site of the proclamation was significant since it was the place of Abraham Lincoln's historic "House Divided" statement in 1858. President announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his running partner on August 23, 2008. Obama chose Joe from a field that also included ex-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, Senate candidate Evan Bayh, and Gov. Tim Kaine. Obama made his commencement address to a gathering of around 84 thousand persons at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium; nearly 3 million citizens saw him. Obama's initiative broke multiple crowdfunding records, notably in the number of small contributions, throughout the primary and general elections. On April 4, 2011, he filed political registration with the Electoral Commission and launched his 2012 new election effort with a segment called "It Begins with Us," which he uploaded on his website. He ran largely uncontested in the Democratic Party presidential primaries as the incoming President, and on April 3, 2012, Obama earned the 2778 convention delegates required to clinch the Democratic candidacy. On November 6, 2012, Obama got 332 delegate votes, which was more than the 270 required for re-election. He then became the first Republican President after Franklin D.

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Obama's inaugural action, reduced the statute of limitations for equivalent claims. In March 2009, he reversed a Bush-era law that prohibited funding for embryos and vowed to set strict standards for the study.
