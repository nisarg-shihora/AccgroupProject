Not every person with a pleasant personality is born with fortune and grace, but they make things happen and get successful through determination and dedication. Dreams convert into reality. In 2019 a student who worked beyond hardship and proved that "Nothing is Impossible in the World" with the right mindset and hard work, Pradeep Singh, is the perfect example of this situation; the struggle that he went through and became an IAS officer inspires many youths. About Pradeep Singh was the name that was all over the news channels and newspapers in 2019. The result of the Union Public Service Commission was released on 4th August 2019, and the name of the topper Pradeep Singh is in the news headlines. Pradeep Singh was from Indore. He did his schooling and accomplished a degree in Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. He decided to attempt the UPSC C exam after completing his graduation. He went to Delhi for coaching and preparation. After seeing Pradeep's dedication and faith, his father sold his house and even their ancestral land and sent him to Delhi for his further preparations. They sacrificed a lot for Pradeep's future. Pradeep worked very hard to appear in UPSC 2018. He was shortlisted on the merit list, and he became an IRS officer by securing All India Rank 260. He wanted to become an IAS officer, and hence he attempted UPSC Civil Service Exam again in 2019 and cleared his exam successfully and became an IAS officer with All India Rank 1. Personal Life Mr Sukhbeer Singh, the father of Pradeep Singh, is a retired sarpanch of Tewari Village in Ganaur of Sonipat district and his mother, Mrs Sheela Devi, is a homemaker.

Later he was enrolled in DCRUST College to complete his graduation with a Bachelor of Engineering in computer science at Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University in 2012. Later on, he decided to appear in the UPSC exam and moved to Delhi for his further preparation. He gave an exam in 2018, and he was selected as an IRS officer. His focus was to become an IAS officer, and hence in his second attempt at the exam, he secured the top position in the exam in India. The two most suitable words that can describe his success in his career are Unstoppable and Unbeatable as he never gave up his hard work even though he faced a lot of adversities. Journey of Pradeep Singh Not just the UPSC aspirants but others too need to be aware of such inspiring personalities like him.

At the National Academy of Customs, Excise, and Narcotics in Faridabad, he was appointed as a probation officer there. He took the UPSC exam a total of four times. Public Administration was his optional subject. Although he joined the coaching classes to prepare for the preparation of the UPSC exam, he later left the coaching due to time constraints and continued the self-study along with his friends. On the 9th of August 2020, Pradeep Singh and his father were invited by the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar. The Chief Minister honoured Pradeep Singh that who made proud not just himself but also his family along with the city of Sonipat and the state of Haryana.

He hopes to work in the agricultural sector and education. His Strategy and Self-Motivation Pradeep Singh was a persona with a good personality; he says that numerous times it was very difficult for him to study and do his job as well. He even thought to get a stop on these studies and preparation in IAS, but his father being his motivational partner, always said that keep on doing his job and studies. And never gave up his patience and potential. He quotes his father's line, "Self-motivation is the best key to achieving any goal. Don't listen to what others are saying; only an individual knows their potential." And also said that "Staying focused may seem difficult, but one has to stay determined to achieve the goal." All his principles and commands helped in determining his career and helped him easier to handle them. Being the Proud Son of Haryana Mr Pradeep Singh IAS, the proud son of India, is a motivational idol for every student, and even all dream comes true. His father, in an interview, said that- "I had told Pradeep to make constant efforts to become an IAS and not think about where I will bring money for his study. Today, he made every Haryana resident proud. He told me that UPSC had declared results, and when I asked him about his result, he came close to me and said he had topped the exam by hugging me. I want to tell all farmers and labourers that their children have more appetite to become an IAS." Pradeep says that "Always be focused and concentrated on the goal. There may be moments when you feel you may not be able to pull it off, but that is the time when your determination helps". Next TopicYogi Adityanath ? prev next ?

Not every person with a pleasant personality is born with fortune and grace, but they make things happen and get successful through determination and dedication. Dreams convert into reality. In 2019 a student who worked beyond hardship and proved that "Nothing is Impossible in the World" with the right mindset and hard work, Pradeep Singh, is the perfect example of this situation; the struggle that he went through and became an IAS officer inspires many youths. About Pradeep Singh was the name that was all over the news channels and newspapers in 2019. The result of the Union Public Service Commission was released on 4th August 2019, and the name of the topper Pradeep Singh is in the news headlines. Pradeep Singh was from Indore. He did his schooling and accomplished a degree in Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. He decided to attempt the UPSC C exam after completing his graduation. He went to Delhi for coaching and preparation. After seeing Pradeep's dedication and faith, his father sold his house and even their ancestral land and sent him to Delhi for his further preparations. They sacrificed a lot for Pradeep's future. Pradeep worked very hard to appear in UPSC 2018. He was shortlisted on the merit list, and he became an IRS officer by securing All India Rank 260. He wanted to become an IAS officer, and hence he attempted UPSC Civil Service Exam again in 2019 and cleared his exam successfully and became an IAS officer with All India Rank 1. Personal Life Mr Sukhbeer Singh, the father of Pradeep Singh, is a retired sarpanch of Tewari Village in Ganaur of Sonipat district and his mother, Mrs Sheela Devi, is a homemaker.

Later he was enrolled in DCRUST College to complete his graduation with a Bachelor of Engineering in computer science at Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University in 2012. Later on, he decided to appear in the UPSC exam and moved to Delhi for his further preparation. He gave an exam in 2018, and he was selected as an IRS officer. His focus was to become an IAS officer, and hence in his second attempt at the exam, he secured the top position in the exam in India. The two most suitable words that can describe his success in his career are Unstoppable and Unbeatable as he never gave up his hard work even though he faced a lot of adversities. Journey of Pradeep Singh Not just the UPSC aspirants but others too need to be aware of such inspiring personalities like him.

At the National Academy of Customs, Excise, and Narcotics in Faridabad, he was appointed as a probation officer there. He took the UPSC exam a total of four times. Public Administration was his optional subject. Although he joined the coaching classes to prepare for the preparation of the UPSC exam, he later left the coaching due to time constraints and continued the self-study along with his friends. On the 9th of August 2020, Pradeep Singh and his father were invited by the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar. The Chief Minister honoured Pradeep Singh that who made proud not just himself but also his family along with the city of Sonipat and the state of Haryana.

He hopes to work in the agricultural sector and education. His Strategy and Self-Motivation Pradeep Singh was a persona with a good personality; he says that numerous times it was very difficult for him to study and do his job as well. He even thought to get a stop on these studies and preparation in IAS, but his father being his motivational partner, always said that keep on doing his job and studies. And never gave up his patience and potential. He quotes his father's line, "Self-motivation is the best key to achieving any goal. Don't listen to what others are saying; only an individual knows their potential." And also said that "Staying focused may seem difficult, but one has to stay determined to achieve the goal." All his principles and commands helped in determining his career and helped him easier to handle them. Being the Proud Son of Haryana Mr Pradeep Singh IAS, the proud son of India, is a motivational idol for every student, and even all dream comes true. His father, in an interview, said that- "I had told Pradeep to make constant efforts to become an IAS and not think about where I will bring money for his study. Today, he made every Haryana resident proud. He told me that UPSC had declared results, and when I asked him about his result, he came close to me and said he had topped the exam by hugging me. I want to tell all farmers and labourers that their children have more appetite to become an IAS." Pradeep says that "Always be focused and concentrated on the goal. There may be moments when you feel you may not be able to pull it off, but that is the time when your determination helps". Next TopicYogi Adityanath ? prev next ?
