It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry.

The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened.

The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram. Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened. It is now a perfect location where the general public receives training based on divine spiritual teachings. It strives to bring back Rishi's heritage. The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram. Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened. It is now a perfect location where the general public receives training based on divine spiritual teachings. It strives to bring back Rishi's heritage. The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened. It is now a perfect location where the general public receives training based on divine spiritual teachings. It strives to bring back Rishi's heritage. The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened. It is now a perfect location where the general public receives training based on divine spiritual teachings. It strives to bring back Rishi's heritage. The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened. It is now a perfect location where the general public receives training based on divine spiritual teachings. It strives to bring back Rishi's heritage. The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction. It promotes national unity and the awakening of people's moral, spiritual, and religious values. This ashram offers spiritual guidance and helps people become even more enlightened. It is now a perfect location where the general public receives training based on divine spiritual teachings. It strives to bring back Rishi's heritage. The primary mission is to help humanity become more divine. Traditional cultural settings, including the Yagya shala, Akhand Deep, and temples like Gayatri Mata Temple and Devatma Himalaya Temple, can be found at the Shantikunj Ashram.

It offers a tapestry of Indian tradition and heritage, serving as a paradise for those who love and adore nature. Hindus revere this location, which is situated at the base of Shivalik Hills. Haridwar is also the first city where Ganga reaches the earth after leaving the Himalayas. The water is chilly and clear here because of this. Green, lush woods and little ponds add to this holy area's aesthetic appeal. The devotees of both Lord Vishnu's (Hari) and Lord Shiva's (Har) pronounce this location as Haridwar and Hardwar, respectively. It is also alluded to as Gangadwar, Mayapuri, and other names in addition to the phrase "Gateway to Gods." In Uttarakhand, there are four prominent pilgrimage sites: Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath. Since Haridwar is regarded as a gateway to these Chardham centers, it is where one must arrive before visiting any of the other locations. According to Hindu mythology, the river Ganga was delivered from heaven to earth by the mythical ruler Bhagirath in order to save and grant redemption to his forefathers. Furthermore, it is asserted that Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, together called the Tridev, have bestowed their blessings on the Haridwar. Hindu devotees believe that taking a plunge into Haridwar's holy Ganga will grant them salvation and allow them to enter heaven. The well-known Kumbh Mela and Ardh Kumbh take place at Haridwar. The Kumbh Mela takes place after a 12-year cycle and the Ardh Kumbh after a 6-year cycle. It is a fantastic location and a fascinating one to visit because of all these wonderful stories and religious ties. Aside from its religious significance, Haridwar was indeed a popular destination for those seeking to learn about the arts, sciences, and culture in ancient times. Haridwar's historical reputation as a premier supplier of Ayurvedic medications and herbal treatments, together with its distinctive Gurukul system of traditional education, natural beauty, and verdant vegetation, all contribute to the city's unique traits and attractiveness. As a result, Haridwar must be listed as one of the holiday destinations on a traveler's itinerary of Uttarakhand. Although Haridwar has a temperate climate all year round, November through March are the best months to visit because of the calm, beautiful weather that is ideal for visiting the area. Haridwar, as we already mentioned, is a sacred region with a number of religious celebrations. So let's take a glance at some of the tourist places in Haridwar. 1. Har Ki Pauri The name Har ki Pauri literally translates to "Footsteps of the Lord" and is one of the popular tourist destinations in Haridwar. It is a well-known ghat in Haridwar that is situated along the Ganges River. After flowing through the Himalayan mountains, the Ganges River reaches the lowlands at this famous ghat. For a spiritual bathe during the Ganga Aarati, devotees throng this revered ghat at the crack of dawn. Here, it is said that a bath in the Ganges River will cleanse one's sins, and they are forgiven. In accordance with the Indian tradition, this is also one among the four locations where the divine bird 'Garuda' unintentionally spilled the droplets of elixir (known as "Amrit"). The devotees offered numerous floating diyas, which made the river fill with golden colors. The tourists visiting Har Ki Pauri particularly love the nighttime hours since it exudes tranquility and peace all day long. Given the abundance of temples along the riverbank, the worshippers' use of lit candles and diyas, all of which are drifting across the water, creates a beautiful sight to witness. The praying and chanting of mantras alongside sages who are in deep meditation emit spiritual energy. When the gongs in the backdrop are heard, one feels transported to a completely new universe. The enormous footsteps on a rock wall are thought to belong to Lord Vishnu because it is considered that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu visited the location during the Vedic era. Daytime visitors find it to be a top attraction. 2. Chandi Devi Temple This Chandi Devi temple is founded on the devotion of the Hindu goddess "Chanda Devi," and it is situated in the Shivalik Hills of Haridwar. This temple, also renowned as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimage sites of Haridwar, a location wherein devotees pray in order to achieve their wishes. It is also a popular destination for trekkers due to its location. A ropeway that offers an amazing perspective can be used to get to the temple's highest point as well. It is best to trek up the hill of Chandi Devi Temple to appreciate its ancient beauty fully. It would undoubtedly sense like a divine presence there due to the lush nature of the area. This shrine receives a lot of visitors all year round because it is one of Haridwar's most renowned and venerable temples. It is recommended to visit the Chandi temple during the festival season, like during the Kumbh Mela festivals; Chandi Chaudas, as well as Navratra, are some of the most joyful times. 3. Mansa Devi Temple The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple that is situated in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. It is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to be a manifestation of Shakti and is supposed to have originated from Lord Shiva's brain. This temple, one of Haridwar's five pilgrimage sites known as the "Panch Tirths," attracts a sizable number of Hindu pilgrims each year. This temple, sometimes referred to as Bilwa Tirth, is located in the Sivalik Hills at the height of Bilwa Parvat. Mansa, which literally translates to "Wish," is the name of the Goddess who, according to her worshippers, grants all the wishes of everyone who enters her temple and is devoted and sincere. As a result, the gorgeous temple is referred to as a "Siddh Peetha," which is a phrase for places wherein wishes and aspirations are realized. Together, the three peethas-the Maya Devi Temple, the Chandi Devi Temple, and this particular Manasa Temple-are found in Haridwar. It is of great religious significance not only because it is a temple but also because Haridwar is thought to be among the four locations where droplets of elixir mistakenly dropped while being transported by Lord Vishnu's chariot, Garuda. It's possible that this is the reason why this magnificent temple in northern India has some of the most visitors. Another feature that contributes to the temple's beauty and draws visitors from all over the nation is the ropeways that ascend to it. 4. Shantikunj A well-known ashram in the world, Shantikunj has become known as the center of moral renewal. It is the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP) headquarters, and it is situated in Haridwar. The AWGP has millions of adherents and is attended by notable figures like the Dalai Lama, who is morally regarded, and other spiritual authorities like Murari Bapu. This pilgrimage location, a school for social and spiritual awakening, has led a lot of lives down the correct path and provided them with enduring satisfaction.

Along with an Exhibition of Divine Culture, it also has temples dedicated to ancient Rishis. 5. Patanjali Yog Peeth In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, there is a yoga and ayurvedic research center called Patanjali Yogpeeth. It is also highly recognized for being one of the largest yoga centers in the entire globe and in India. Rishi Patanjali, who is credited with creating Yoga, is honored with the naming of the institute, which is Baba Ramdev's distinctive undertaking. It is one of the best tourist spots in Haridwar if one is enthusiastic about the traditional science of Ayurveda and the fitness tricks of Yoga. In 2006, Baba Ramdev founded the institution. It was created with the intention of practicing and developing Yoga, researching Ayurveda, and producing Ayurvedic medications. By eradicating illnesses without the need for allopathic medicine and its adverse effects, it seeks to bring about world peace, healthy life, and satisfaction. Yoga treatment and therapy serve as the key tool for achieving this. This Yogpeeth is frequented by those seeking Ayurvedic care and drugs. It's interesting to note that in addition to Ayurvedic therapies, there are divisions for study and research-focused laboratories, as well as facilities for a canteen, residential housing, and an ATM for use. This Yogapeeth institution has two campuses, the Patanjali Yogapeeth I and the Patanjali Yogapeeth II. Both of these divisions work together to carry out social welfare initiatives in the medical fields, schooling, and other social, cultural, and economic activities. The institute offers regular yoga sessions and training in a number of different yoga techniques. It also has a hospital where travelers from all around the world can receive ayurvedic care. It's because a production facility for ayurvedic medicines is located here. There is a lodging option available for guests who want to stay in this location. 6. Bara Bazar Bara Bazar is one of the tourist destinations in Haridwar for people who want to enjoy shopping and purchasing the items that Haridwar is well known for. This bustling Bazar is the city's major shopping destination. This crowded alley market is stocked with religious souvenirs and other accessories for both domestic and international visitors who are flocking in large numbers. Here, one may find everything from Rudraksha seeds to herbal goods and medications to digestive supplements like Churans to artisan goods and jewelry. It is also a fantastic area to shop for wooden goods, and for those who enjoy sweets, there are many different kinds of sweets available in sweet stores. The regional specialty created from milk, "Pedas," deserves special note. The delectable Peda that is sold here in great quantities can be consumed and taken home. 7. Pawan Dham The renowned Pawan Dham is only 3 kilometers away from Har ki Pauri. It is both a historical temple and a charitable organization. Swami Vedantanand Ji Maharaj built this temple. The Geeta Bhawan Trust Society of Moga currently oversees its management. Features of this famous landmark include the gorgeous idols decked with priceless jewels and gemstones, together with the intricate architecture, magnificent interiors, and excellent glasswork. The Hindu shrine is built in a stunning style that dates back to ancient India. It displays the uniquely built walls that leave tourists speechless at their beauty. Other than that, the stunning sculpture of Lord Krishna, who is depicted teaching Arjun, is the biggest attraction here. This temple, known as the Glass Temple (because of its elaborate mirror and glasswork), is well-known among both local and international tourists, in addition to Hindu devotees. It is thought that paying reverence before the temple cleanses one of their sins. Due to its proximity to other well-known religious tourist destinations like Har ki Pauri, the journey to get there is straightforward. From ISBT, Anand Vihar, a regular bus to Haridwar, runs every few minutes. Additionally, Pawan Dham is only 5 kilometers from the closest railway station in Haridwar. 8. Saptrishi Ashram Another of the most well-known ashrams in Haridwar was founded in 1943 by Guru Goswami Dutt and is called Sapt Rishi Ashram. On the banks of the Ganga, it is situated 5 kilometers from Haridwar (Sapt Sarovar). It is located at the point from which the river divides into seven separate tributaries, sometimes referred to as Sapta Sarovar. This ashram is well renowned for having accommodated seven great gurus, including Gautam, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagi, Vashishta, Atri, and Bharadwaja. It is also well known for having a calm atmosphere that is ideal for meditation. For yoga fans and those seeking solace and fulfillment on a spiritual level, this place is a must-visit. In this immaculate complex, there are several different lodging alternatives. In accordance with mythical accounts, the Ganges River was divided into seven channels to prevent the sages from being disturbed by the noise of flowing water. Because of this, the ashram is sometimes referred to as Sapt Sarovar or Sapt Rishi Kund. All around the world, sages, and gurus regard this ashram in great regard owing to its spiritual importance. The ashram is maintained in a well-kept facility that includes a residential hostel and a Sanskrit school for underprivileged kids. 9. Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?

Bharat Mata Mandir Bharat Mata Mandir is the most distinctive of all the well-known beautiful temples, which ends up making Haridwar a center for all those looking for Divinity. Because India as a country is revered here as a deity, this shrine is very special. The Haridwar temple, known as Bharat Mata Mandir, takes its name from the fact that it is devoted to India as a nation. Its name means "The Mother India Temple." It's interesting to note that the multi-story shrine in Sapt Sarovar honors the numerous patriots and freedom warriors who fought for India's independence rather than being a temple that practices any form of religion or idolatry. This magnificent temple also honors India's distinctive quality and extensive cultural heritage. It draws our attention to a number of things, including the nation's unity and diversity. This temple monument is an eight-story structure that is erected close to the Ganges River. There are no other temples like this one in Haridwar; hence its architecture is highly unique. In the year 1983, this temple was launched by the former and first female Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, just a year before her assassination in 1984. A minimum of 8 stories, each with a different theme, make up the 180-foot-tall temple. Themes associated with various legendary histories and deities are featured on each floor. A sizable map of Mother India covers the floor of the temple. It refers to the sculpture of the mother of India, which is shown as a multi-armed Hindu deity carrying a book, a stack or bundle of rice, a garland, and a white cloth while dressed in saffron-colored garments. The architecture of this statue symbolizes the Goddesses of India, the patroness of all spiritual beings, leaders, and liberation fighters. The temple honors everyone who contributed to the creation of India. To assist the visitors, elevators have been placed at the shrine. This place, in addition to being a holy spot, also includes old age care, an allopathic pharmacy, diagnostic clinics, a cow shelter, and a ved shala. The Bharat Mata Mandir has several stories, including the following: The first floor has a mother India statue that inspires patriotism in the worshippers. The "Shoor Mandir" is displayed on the second level, which is devoted to India's legendary warriors. The "Matru Mandir," which is reflected on the third level, honors historical Indian women like Meera and Savitri. On the fourth floor is the "Sant Mandir," which honors famous saints from various parts of India. Various wall artworks illustrating the harmonious coexistence of various Indian religions can be found on the fifth floor. The sixth-floor honors and represents the various manifestations of the Goddess Shakti. The seventh floor displays Lord Vishnu, the Hindu goddess, in all of her avatars. Lord Shiva is honored with a shrine on the eighth and last floor since, in Hinduism, he is regarded as the ultimate god and the god of all gods. Visitors may view the stunning Haridwar skyline and the hills of Rajaji National Park from this 180-foot-tall temple's vantage point. At last, we can say that Bharat Mata Mandir is unquestionably one of the most attractive things to explore around Haridwar. 10. Maya Devi Temple The Maya Devi Temple, which honors Goddess Maya Devi, an avatar of Goddess Shakti, is one of the highlights of Haridwar. In the past, Haridwar was referred to as Mayapuri since the Goddess Maya was its patron. The Maya Devi temple completes the triad of Siddh Peeths in Haridwar. The Maya Devi temple in Haridwar is one of the country's oldest temples; it was constructed in the eleventh century. The temple is thought to have been constructed over the spot where Sati's heart and navel are said to have fallen in legend. Adi Shakti, the Goddess of heavenly force, is thought to take the guise of Goddess Maya. During Navratra and the Kumbh Mela, many worshippers of the Goddess come to seek her graces. Maya Devi is widely regarded as the principal Goddess of the holy city, and a pilgrimage is considered incomplete without receiving a glimpse of Devi. Among the 3 oldest temples in Haridwar that are still standing is the ancient Maya Devi Temple, along with Narayana-Shila and Bhairava Temple. Besides the idol of the Goddess Maya, the hallowed shrine also houses the idols of the Adi para shakti-inspired goddesses Kamakhya and Kali. According to popular belief, the holy temple is a Siddha peeth, which implies that the Goddess who presides over it has the authority to grant any wishes or aspirations of the individuals who seek Her blessings. In addition to being a sacred site for worship, the temple is renowned for the elegance of its historic architecture. The temple is well-known for its lavish decorations and festivities during the Navaratri and Kumbh Mela celebrations. Next TopicTourist Places in Pachmarhi ? prev next ?
