Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu.

It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport.

The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km).

About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan.

Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport. Firstly, one has to reach a place called Pampa in Sabarimala. From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan. The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km).

About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport. Firstly, one has to reach a place called Pampa in Sabarimala. From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan. The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km). Trains for these stations are easily available. By Airways Thiruvananthapuram airport and Kochi Airport, which are 170 km and 160 km, respectively, are the nearest airports from Pampa. There is also a Heliport service available in Perunad for Pampa, which is 40 km away from Pampa, called Sabarimala Helipad. By Roadways Bus services are available from Eruneli, Kottayam, Chengannur, Coimbatore, Pandalam, and Kumili every day. A chain service is also available between Pampa and Nilachal base camps. About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan. Other temples include the Nagarajav shrine, Pampa Ganapathi temple, Palliyara Bhagavati temple, and Nilakal Mahadeva temple in the complex.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport. Firstly, one has to reach a place called Pampa in Sabarimala. From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan. The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km). Trains for these stations are easily available. By Airways Thiruvananthapuram airport and Kochi Airport, which are 170 km and 160 km, respectively, are the nearest airports from Pampa. There is also a Heliport service available in Perunad for Pampa, which is 40 km away from Pampa, called Sabarimala Helipad. By Roadways Bus services are available from Eruneli, Kottayam, Chengannur, Coimbatore, Pandalam, and Kumili every day. A chain service is also available between Pampa and Nilachal base camps. About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan.

About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport. Firstly, one has to reach a place called Pampa in Sabarimala. From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan. The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km). Trains for these stations are easily available. By Airways Thiruvananthapuram airport and Kochi Airport, which are 170 km and 160 km, respectively, are the nearest airports from Pampa. There is also a Heliport service available in Perunad for Pampa, which is 40 km away from Pampa, called Sabarimala Helipad. By Roadways Bus services are available from Eruneli, Kottayam, Chengannur, Coimbatore, Pandalam, and Kumili every day. A chain service is also available between Pampa and Nilachal base camps. About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport. Firstly, one has to reach a place called Pampa in Sabarimala. From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan. The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km). Trains for these stations are easily available. By Airways Thiruvananthapuram airport and Kochi Airport, which are 170 km and 160 km, respectively, are the nearest airports from Pampa. There is also a Heliport service available in Perunad for Pampa, which is 40 km away from Pampa, called Sabarimala Helipad. By Roadways Bus services are available from Eruneli, Kottayam, Chengannur, Coimbatore, Pandalam, and Kumili every day. A chain service is also available between Pampa and Nilachal base camps. About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan. Other temples include the Nagarajav shrine, Pampa Ganapathi temple, Palliyara Bhagavati temple, and Nilakal Mahadeva temple in the complex.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport. Firstly, one has to reach a place called Pampa in Sabarimala. From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan. The walking and trekking route to Sabarimala temple is very developed with shops, emergency health facilities, doli services, etc. Different ways to reach Pampa By Railways The nearest railway stations from Pampa are Kottayam (92km), Tiruvallur (87 km), and Chengannur (82 km). Trains for these stations are easily available. By Airways Thiruvananthapuram airport and Kochi Airport, which are 170 km and 160 km, respectively, are the nearest airports from Pampa. There is also a Heliport service available in Perunad for Pampa, which is 40 km away from Pampa, called Sabarimala Helipad. By Roadways Bus services are available from Eruneli, Kottayam, Chengannur, Coimbatore, Pandalam, and Kumili every day. A chain service is also available between Pampa and Nilachal base camps. About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan.

Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them.

The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple.

About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma.

Annually 40 million pilgrims come here from around the world. It is one the most sacred place among followers of Hinduism, majorly in the southern part of India. This pilgrimage site is regarded as the conflux point of two main groups of Hinduism- Shaivism, and Vaishnavism because God Ayyappan is believed to be the progeny of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Location Sabarimala temple is in the Perinad Village of the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India. It is at the Sabarimala Hill, 1260 m above sea level, near Periyar Tiger Reserve in Poongavanam Forest. How to Reach One can reach Sabarimala temple from all modes of transport.

From Pampa, there is a walk of 5 km through the forest, and after the trek of 1535 feet of a high hill, one can have the darshan of Shri Ayyappan.

About Lord Ayyappan How He Became The God There was a demon named Mahisasur, who was very brutal and was killing God's community. Then all of them requested Maa Durga to kill Mahisasur, which she did, as she herself was the Shakti (the power). This story related to Maa Durga and Mahisasur is known to most of us. But this was not the end; from here, another story starts. Mahisi, a female demon, is regarded as the wife of Mahisasur in some mythological texts, whereas the sister of Mahisasur is in some texts. She was very upset with the killing of Mahisasur, and she pledged to take revenge for the killing and started penance. Through her penance, she pleased Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared before her, he asked her to tell him her wish. She demanded to make her immortal. Lord Brahma refused her wish by saying that it is against nature, he can't approve of it and gave her the option that she can choose the way of her death. Then she agreed and asked Brahma Ji that grant her wish that she could be killed only by the child of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, which she thought that it was impossible because both of them were male, and two males can't give birth to a child. Now, she thought that she could not die and started her revenge by killing God's community, and her threat spread everywhere; everyone in Swarg Lok was in Panic. Then, all of them went to Lord Vishnu for help. Lord Vishnu took his female avatar as Mohini and went to Lord Shiva, and then Shiv Ji gave his seed to Mohini without any intimacy. With that, Mohini got pregnant and, after some time, gave birth to a boy child; he was the god Ayyappan. After that, Lord Shiva told Mohini that this boy child would be taken care of by his devotee, who was the King of Pandalam, King Rajasekhar; he did not have any child at that time. Then Mohini left this child in a basket by tying a golden bell to his neck in the Pampa River. King Rajasekhar found this child with a golden bell and named him Manikandan. He was named Manikandan because of that golden bell on his neck, as Mani means golden bell and Kandan means neck. As time passed, he grew, and the queen also gave birth to a child. But the queen started to feel that after the king, Manikandan would become the king, not his own child, and she started getting jealous of him. One day she did a conspiracy and acted like she was ill, Vaidya was called, and he, under the direction of the queen, told her that only the milk of the tigress of the forest could cure the queen. Hearing this, 11-year-old Manikandan agreed to go to the forest; they succeeded in their plan and thought that Manikandan would die. Little Manikandan went to the forest, where he met the demon Mahisi, who cordoned there for him, then Manikandan and Mahisi fought with each other, and finally, she was killed by him. After that, all the tiger and tigress bowed down to him, and he came back to his palace, sitting on the back of the tigress. This incident envisaged everyone that Manikandan is not a normal boy but an incarnation of God. After that, it is said that one day he came in the dream of his father, king Rajshekhar, and asked him to build a temple in the hills of Sabarimala. On God Manikandan's order, the king built the temple of Ayyappan, which we know as the Sabarimala temple. Shasta has been worshipped for a long-ago in south India and has been a part of its tradition. Lord Manikandan is believed to be the avatar of Shasta. It is also said that Lord Parshuram set up five Shasta in the world, and this Ayyappan temple is one of them. Here Lord Ayyappan is in the form of Naistika Brahmachari (also known as Vanaprastha) means an unmarried virgin. This is the reason women between the age group of 10- 50 years were not allowed inside the temple. Inside the Temple The main temple where Lord Ayyappan resided is known as Sannidhanam, built on a 40ft high plateau. The sanctum has a gold plated roof with four golden hip-knobs at the top, the place of altar called balikapura, and two mandapam. The deity of Ayyappan is made of Panchaloha (a mix of 5 metals). Other than that, in the southwest of Sannidhanam, there is Kannimoola Ganapathi Prathishta, devoted to Lord Ganesh. After that, there is Pathinettu Thripadikal, also known as the 18 sacred steps, going to the temple. At the foot of this stepway, there are two guards, namely Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, both of them are lieutenants of Lord Ayyappan. There is another very important temple near Sannidhanam is the temple of Maalikapurath amma, set up by Brahmashree Kandararu Maheshwararu Thanthri. It is said that Maalikapurath amma was the daughter of Cheerappanchira, who taught Kalaripayattu to Lord Ayyappan. Other temples include the Nagarajav shrine, Pampa Ganapathi temple, Palliyara Bhagavati temple, and Nilakal Mahadeva temple in the complex.
