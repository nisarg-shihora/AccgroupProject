You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces.

At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7.

The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM.

This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand.

The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini.

The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power.

The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis.

If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record. Sadly, this car is a one-off, so yes, it was commissioned by one client to be produced by Mercedes for themselves. As you have already read the name, if you do possess some knowledge about cars, you might have recognized the Maybach in the name, which suggests that the car uses Maybach as its basis. The car is equipped with a 5.9 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine, which outputs a power of 690 bhp and a torque of 1020 NM. The car can go as fast as 350 kmph / 218 mph and accelerates from 0 to 100 kmph in 4.4 seconds. The airflow in the vehicle is absolutely well designed, to say the least. Even if you don't understand it in detail alone, consider that the car is quite a heavy car, and yet it has incredible stability and efficiency. 7. Lamborghini Veneno Next up, we have none other than the Lamborghini. It is by far the most expensive car Lamborghini has produced. The car was released in celebration of Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. The car is based on the Lamborghini Aventador, and so it was also built with the same engine powering it as the Aventador, but this one was tuned in order to output more power. The engine used in the car is a 6948 cc 6.5 L V12 engine. The maximum power and maximum torque achieved by the car are 750 bhp and 690 NM, respectively. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 355 kmph. As for the fuel tank, the car has a 90 L capacity. The car itself is a fine piece of beauty, both visually and mechanically. The front and rear arches design allow the car to minimize excessive lift by directing air around the car. From the interior, the car heavily follows the Aventador with newer elements. 8. Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 The car is based on the Aventador SVJ from Lamborghini and, as such, uses the same 6498 cc 6.5 L V12 engine, but it is also paired with a 611 kW mild hybrid system. The release of this car marked the first time ever that Lamborghini's car used electrical energy for torque. There are a total of 63 of these are produced by Lamborghini. The car has a top speed of 350 kmph and takes about 2.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph. It has a power output of 808 bhp and a 720 NM torque. While the car has a newer design, it does take many cues from the Lamborghini Countach for the exterior, and as for the interior, it is inspired by the good old Aventador but with some newer and fancier styling and features present in it. The outside irrelevance of its design compared to some iconic Lamborghini automobiles is due to the fact that Lamborghini has designed this car from scratch to allow for innovation. 9. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC Here comes Pagani finally; if you have been wondering if it was on the list because of the other brands above, then rest assured, there is simply no way not to include this brand. This car, as the name sounds, is a later released variant of the Huayra BC. It is the variant with a removable top, and it is not only that which has changed. The car runs on the same engine as its predecessor - a 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12, but it has been changed to allow the car to output an extra 50 horsepower. The car produces 800 bhp of power and 1049 NM of torque. There are only 40 units made for this car, so it is quite rare, and the engine's roars are surely pretty satisfying. As for mechanical design, the aero elements are always movable, and along with them are the titanium exhaust pipes, both of which allow diversion of exhaustion gases and provide better air in-and-out systems. 10. W Motors Lykan Hypersport This car is barely an automobile, and it is something much more, something that surprised and shook everyone. At the time when this car was unveiled for the first time, it was the 3rd most expensive car money could buy. What makes this car special is that not only does it consists of a completely holographic display along with a total of 420 15-carat diamonds inside its LED lights what the brand did really stunned everyone and left a mark. The car isn't behind in terms of technical specs either. It runs on a 3.7 L twin-turbocharged engine, which is capable of outputting a max power of 780 bhp and a max torque of 960 NM. Also, for the fans of fast and furious, this car is one of those which achieved screentime in fast and furious 7. The car also goes from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 395 kmph. 11. Aston Martin Valkyrie A super-rare supercar with a limited production run of 150 pieces. The vehicle is propelled by a 6.5-liter aspirated V12 engine with a maximum output of 1160 horsepower and 900 NM of torque. The vehicle can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in around 3 seconds and has a top speed of 402 kmph/250 mph. It uses rear-facing cameras rather than conventional external mirrors to improve aerodynamics. Images captured by the cameras are displayed in the cabin. The Valkyrie has not even a single steel component in its body, unlike several others that are partially comprised of carbon fiber. The interior of the vehicle resembles a Formula 1 racing car in terms of layout. It includes a detachable steering wheel and is well-built from the inside to be comfortable even after long hours. To put it mildly, the car's design and bodywork are magnificent. Next Topic# ? prev next ?

You might be a rookie when it comes to picking top cars or an expert, either way, it is not possible for one person to know about all the leading car models or to keep up with all new releases, and all while deciding which one is the best. This list makes the job much easier. Ranking cars is quite a difficult job, considering the variety of features and different criteria to follow. They can be ranked based on the best engine displacements with the highest horsepower, the highest speeds achievable by the car, the one with the best acceleration, the one with the best aerodynamics and stability, etc. And to top it all off, we have the design of the cars to compare as well, which includes not only the looks of their exterior and interior but also the quality of material used along with the safety as well as comfort features the car offers. It is natural to need some assistance, hence is why we have prepared this list of best cars with their most notable specs. Although, do take note that due to the different criteria for comparisons, making an ideal list is nearly impossible, and as such, these cars have been ranked according to their overall score in every department. If you prefer one type of criteria over the other, feel free to have a personal list with these cars rearranged to your liking. Here we go, then. 1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail There is no other car as expensive as this one, costing over $28 million. While it indeed is extremely hard to get your hands on due to the sheer pricing of this car, what's more enticing is, this car is the rarest thing to be found, the reason being that it is a limited production car with only 3 units to be ever produced! The cars designed were commissioned by the 3 clients and hence have different designs in order to match the personal tastes of the clients. The cars have a similar body style, but their appearances, as well as some features in them, are different. It has some of the coolest features, which include rotating cocktail tables, a complete set of tableware from the highly reputed Christofle, two fridges, and a separate champagne cooler as well. Although much cannot be said about this car as not all information has been released, we do have some expected details. The car is most likely based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom, in which case the expected engine is a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine outputting power of 563 hp. Everyone is eagerly looking forward to this car; make sure you keep an eye out for it because it is one of a kind to be found, and if you are interested in it, make sure you stay on the watch. Who knows, you might become their next client with their own Rolls-Royce Boat Tail customized to your liking. 2. Bugatti La Voiture Noire The most expensive car to be ever produced by Bugatti. Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars and is the rarest one to exist. The reason is that this car has a Gold version which serves as the flagship, and there is only one of these manufactured; yeah, you heard right, only one. Although, you still can get your hands on its silver versions, as they are the little toned-down brothers. This car is made as a reinterpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal car, the Type 57 SC Atlantic. It uses the same engine as the Bugatti Chiron as its basis - a 7993 cc 8.0L W16 engine. The power output is 1500 bhp, and the torque output is 1600NM, and the car has a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds. The outside design represents the very essence of Bugatti's motto. The whole body speaks of elegance and eye-grabbing features. The body is a single-piece work of craftsmanship that is handcrafted with carbon fiber from head to toe, giving it an all-black look. Not to mention the headlight design and light patterns being the cherry on top. 3. Rolls Royce Sweptail Rolls Royce doesn't know how to limit their prices and neither about when to quit trying to make the car as good as they can. Their work surely does pay off, which is just shown by their reputation and by what they always provide. The Sweptail features a 6.75 L V12 engine which outputs 453 horsepower and a torque of 531 NM. The car is one of the heaviest ones out there, due to which excellent aerodynamics is a necessity, which Rolls Royce has taken care of with great expertise. The car takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 mph to 60 mph, and the top speed goes upto 250 kmph / 155 mph. Unlike the previous car on this list, where a toned-down variant was available, this car is custom-made for one person by the company, and as such, there is just one of these in the entire world. No lower-tier variants this time, just a plain and simple one. 4. Bugatti Centodieci If you think there seems to be a little too many of Rolls Royce and Bugatti here, that is just because the brands have earned it with their splendid models each time. Time to take a look at another one of Bugatti's top masterpieces - the Bugatti Centodieci. The vehicle serves as a symbol of the 110th anniversary of the Bugatti brand. The EB110, one of the best supercars of its era, is also reported to be reinterpreted in the vehicle. Despite being slower than the Chiron, it nonetheless meets everyone's expectations. Given that there will only be 10 of them made, it is safe to assume that the majority will never even see it. A quad-turbocharged 8.0 l W16 engine with an output of 8000 cc powers the vehicle. It can accelerate from 0 kmph to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds thanks to its 1578 bhp maximum power and 1600 Nm maximum torque. Its maximum speed is 379.80 kph (236 mph). The original EB110 serves as a design inspiration for several aspects of the vehicle, including the design of the air inlet. The design keeps the character of the original car while also meeting better thermal standards. 5. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ If you like to stay updated about top gear in the world, you must have heard of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. For those who don't, this car is hands down the fastest 4-wheeler you'll find on the planet. It broke all records by reaching a speed of 482.80 kmph or 300mph. And, it is not just speed alone that makes this car number one overall. The car has excellent design, not only in terms of aesthetics but in terms of providing smooth butter performance. You can't expect a car to have such high speed without a good stability level. The car is optimized to have maximum stability even if you drives at speeds of over 420 kmph. For other specifications, the car boasts an 8.0 l W16 engine, and it outputs a torque of 1600NM and a horsepower of 1577 bhp. The car is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 kmph in 2.4 seconds. If you want a new one, you are out of luck because there are only 30 of these manufactured by Bugatti, so you will have to settle for a second-hand one from someone who owns it. It has a fuel tank of 100L capacity. The car also contains diamond-tipped tweeters for delivering top-notch sound inside the car and also boasts multi-configurable TFT screens as well as an infotainment system built into it. 6. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero It is not possible for anyone not to include Mercedes in their top cars list even if they tried, all thanks to the brand's performance as well as popularity record.
