Political Career Praja Rajyam Party In 2008, Kalyan began his political career as the leader of Yuvarajyam, the youth branch of Chiranjeevi's elder brother's Praja Rajyam Party. He didn't hold any constitutional positions or contest any election when he was a member of the Praja Rajyam Party. He actively took part in the party's election campaign, although he also experienced some health issues. As a result of a sunstroke he had on April 19, 2009, while attending a roadshow in Vizag, Kalyan experienced health issues. Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party with the Congress, Kalyan withdrew from politics, expressing his quiet displeasure with his brother's choice to merge the parties. In 2014, Kalyan founded a new political party named Jana Sena party. Jana Sena Party Kalyan started the Jana Sena Party on March 14, 2014. Ism, the title of a book he published, is also the philosophy of the Jana Sena Party. He met with then-BJP Prime Minister candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues impacting both Telugu states and pledged his support. He enthusiastically promoted the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao, which translates to "Stop Congress, Save the Country" in Hindi, was his rallying cry in opposition to the Congress party's control. His rallies in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana drew "huge audiences," according to the Deccan-Journal. He said in August 2017 that his intention was to begin his full-time political career in October 2017, following the completion of his film-related obligations. By staging many demonstrations and a hunger strike, he sparked the Uddanam kidney disease crisis, which the Andhra Pradesh government ultimately contained by building dialysis clinics and executing different programs for the hamlet. In 2016 Kalyan said that Jana Sena would run in the Andhra Pradesh general elections in 2019. He declared that he intended to run unaligned in each of Andhra Pradesh's 175 legislatures. He objected to the national government's plan to hand the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) to private investors. Kalyan led a protest march to pay tribute to farmers who committed suicide or left Rayalaseema's drought-prone districts. He disagreed with the TDP government's plan to pool land. Demanding political responsibility, Kalyan organized a march on Rajahmundry's historic Dowleswaram Barrage. In the Vanthada village of Prathipadu in the East Godavari district, he allegedly revealed unrestricted mining. At a public event in Rajahmundry, Kalyan unveiled the Jana Sena party's 2019 election manifesto, which includes several initiatives to enhance the lives of farmers, farmworkers, women, youth, and students. In both the Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, his party will run alongside the left-leaning Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and Bahujan Samaj Party in the forthcoming 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, the Jana Sena Party contested its party candidates in 140 constituencies, Kalyan took candidature for two seats, Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram. YSR Congress Party candidates defeated him in both elections. The sole seat his party has won in the election comes from Razole. Later that year, on November 3, 2019, Kalyan organized a protest in Visakhapatnam in support of unemployed construction workers who were protesting against the YSR Congress Party's rule since there wasn't enough sand available in Andhra Pradesh. After three years of distancing himself from the BJP, Kalyan declared his party's union with the BJP on January 16, 2020. In the forthcoming 2024 elections, both parties will run as a team. He was the rally's leader on February 12, 2020, in support of Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old who had been cruelly raped and killed in Kurnool. He asked that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) investigate the event. Next TopicPROPHET MUHAMMAD ? prev next ?
