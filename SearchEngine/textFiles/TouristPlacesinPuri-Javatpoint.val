Mausi Maa Temple The Mausi Maa sanctuary is arranged at the mid-method of the Bada danda or Grand Street of Puri. It is a little sanctuary committed to Goddess Ardhashini. According to Jagannath folklore, when Goddess Lakshmi Devi left Shri Mandira, as a result of that Jagannath and Balabhadra become poverty-stricken and needed to go out for asking. Mausi Maa is likewise named Ardhashosini. It has been referenced in the Vaisanava Kanda of the Skanda Purana that Goddess Ardhashosini drank half of the ocean water that overflowed Puri and saved the residence of Shri Jagannath. Goddess Ardhashosini with Kapalamochana Shiva, go about as the watchmen of the Shree Kshetra. During the Ratha yatra celebration's return journey (Bahuda yatra), Shri Jagannath's chariot stops at the Mausi Maa sanctuary, where the deity is given their favourite Poda Pitha, a warm cake composed of rice and lentils. 3.

Gundicha Temple In the Indian state of Odisha, the temple town of Puri, sits the Gundicha Temple, a Hindu temple. Being the final stop of the renowned yearly Rath Yatra of Puri gives it significance. During the yearly Rath Yatra festival, the temple, which is usually empty most of the year, is inhabited by statues of Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra for seven full days (totaling nine days if you count the beginning and end of Ratha Yatra).

As a protector of the temple complex, Vimala is regarded as Jagannath's sister. Before worshipping Jagannath in the main temple, devotees pay respect to Vimala. Before being served to Vimala, foods served to Jagannath become sanctified as Mahaprasad. In the Hindu month of Ashvin (October), the goddess-centered celebration of Durga Puja is observed at Vimala for sixteen days, concluding with Vijayadashami. 7.
