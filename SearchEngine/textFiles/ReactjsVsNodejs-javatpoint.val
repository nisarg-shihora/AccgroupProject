Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site. Developer price per hour It is based on the Upwork information. The hourly rate for Node.js may vary: Basic back-end: $ 15-50 + Full Stack Developer: $ 30-150 + According to Upwork, hourly rates will vary as follows: Front-End: basic $ 15- $ 50, between $ 35- $ 100; Back-End: Basic $ 15- $ 50, Advanced $ 35- $ 100; Full-Stack Developer: $ 30 - $ 150. The difference between Node.js and React.js are below: Difference point Node.Js React.Js Frame It's a back-end frame. It is mainly used to develop user interfaces Model View Framework Support It is used to support the Model-View Framework It does not support Model-View Framework. Development process It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I / O paradigm developed in C ++ and works at Chrome's v8 engine. It compiles or optimizes the JavaScript code using Node.js, and it's easy to develop UI test cases. Features Node.js handles the browser requests and authentication of database calls. It makes API calls and also handles data. Data tracking Real-time data streaming is handled here. Its sophisticated design makes the old technology difficult to keep track of in React. Library The most comprehensive ecosystem of open source libraries for JavaScript execution. Facebook supports Open Source JS library. Programming languages used Only JavaScript is used as a programming language. JSX and JavaScript are the languages used in React js. Document object model concept There is no use of the Document Object Model (DOM) here in Node js. Virtual Document Object Model using here to make the working faster. Adaptability of users Node.js is very simple to understand. React.js is so tough to learn. Scalability Highly scalable. Scalability is a challenge. Architecture The architecture is quite simple. React.js has a complex architecture. Microservices Since it's easy - it's easy to write microservices. It's hard to write microservices in React.Js Dynamics It can handle single operations efficiently. The large USP for React.js handles dynamic events. Support The code is written in Java and easily converted into machine code. Both iOS and Android support it. Caching It caches the individual modules for efficient driving time. Here, the code reusability and DOM are focused. Which is the better option (Node js Vs React js)? Both Node.js vs React.js is modern technologies used by many successful companies. But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;

But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site. Developer price per hour It is based on the Upwork information. The hourly rate for Node.js may vary: Basic back-end: $ 15-50 + Full Stack Developer: $ 30-150 + According to Upwork, hourly rates will vary as follows: Front-End: basic $ 15- $ 50, between $ 35- $ 100; Back-End: Basic $ 15- $ 50, Advanced $ 35- $ 100; Full-Stack Developer: $ 30 - $ 150. The difference between Node.js and React.js are below: Difference point Node.Js React.Js Frame It's a back-end frame. It is mainly used to develop user interfaces Model View Framework Support It is used to support the Model-View Framework It does not support Model-View Framework. Development process It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I / O paradigm developed in C ++ and works at Chrome's v8 engine. It compiles or optimizes the JavaScript code using Node.js, and it's easy to develop UI test cases. Features Node.js handles the browser requests and authentication of database calls. It makes API calls and also handles data. Data tracking Real-time data streaming is handled here. Its sophisticated design makes the old technology difficult to keep track of in React. Library The most comprehensive ecosystem of open source libraries for JavaScript execution. Facebook supports Open Source JS library. Programming languages used Only JavaScript is used as a programming language. JSX and JavaScript are the languages used in React js. Document object model concept There is no use of the Document Object Model (DOM) here in Node js. Virtual Document Object Model using here to make the working faster. Adaptability of users Node.js is very simple to understand. React.js is so tough to learn. Scalability Highly scalable. Scalability is a challenge. Architecture The architecture is quite simple. React.js has a complex architecture. Microservices Since it's easy - it's easy to write microservices. It's hard to write microservices in React.Js Dynamics It can handle single operations efficiently. The large USP for React.js handles dynamic events. Support The code is written in Java and easily converted into machine code. Both iOS and Android support it. Caching It caches the individual modules for efficient driving time. Here, the code reusability and DOM are focused. Which is the better option (Node js Vs React js)? Both Node.js vs React.js is modern technologies used by many successful companies. But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance.

Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site. Developer price per hour It is based on the Upwork information. The hourly rate for Node.js may vary: Basic back-end: $ 15-50 + Full Stack Developer: $ 30-150 + According to Upwork, hourly rates will vary as follows: Front-End: basic $ 15- $ 50, between $ 35- $ 100; Back-End: Basic $ 15- $ 50, Advanced $ 35- $ 100; Full-Stack Developer: $ 30 - $ 150.

But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time.

But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site. Developer price per hour It is based on the Upwork information. The hourly rate for Node.js may vary: Basic back-end: $ 15-50 + Full Stack Developer: $ 30-150 + According to Upwork, hourly rates will vary as follows: Front-End: basic $ 15- $ 50, between $ 35- $ 100; Back-End: Basic $ 15- $ 50, Advanced $ 35- $ 100; Full-Stack Developer: $ 30 - $ 150. The difference between Node.js and React.js are below: Difference point Node.Js React.Js Frame It's a back-end frame.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js. Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site. Developer price per hour It is based on the Upwork information. The hourly rate for Node.js may vary: Basic back-end: $ 15-50 + Full Stack Developer: $ 30-150 + According to Upwork, hourly rates will vary as follows: Front-End: basic $ 15- $ 50, between $ 35- $ 100; Back-End: Basic $ 15- $ 50, Advanced $ 35- $ 100; Full-Stack Developer: $ 30 - $ 150. The difference between Node.js and React.js are below: Difference point Node.Js React.Js Frame It's a back-end frame. It is mainly used to develop user interfaces Model View Framework Support It is used to support the Model-View Framework It does not support Model-View Framework. Development process It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I / O paradigm developed in C ++ and works at Chrome's v8 engine. It compiles or optimizes the JavaScript code using Node.js, and it's easy to develop UI test cases. Features Node.js handles the browser requests and authentication of database calls. It makes API calls and also handles data. Data tracking Real-time data streaming is handled here. Its sophisticated design makes the old technology difficult to keep track of in React. Library The most comprehensive ecosystem of open source libraries for JavaScript execution. Facebook supports Open Source JS library. Programming languages used Only JavaScript is used as a programming language. JSX and JavaScript are the languages used in React js. Document object model concept There is no use of the Document Object Model (DOM) here in Node js. Virtual Document Object Model using here to make the working faster. Adaptability of users Node.js is very simple to understand. React.js is so tough to learn. Scalability Highly scalable. Scalability is a challenge. Architecture The architecture is quite simple. React.js has a complex architecture. Microservices Since it's easy - it's easy to write microservices. It's hard to write microservices in React.Js Dynamics It can handle single operations efficiently. The large USP for React.js handles dynamic events. Support The code is written in Java and easily converted into machine code. Both iOS and Android support it. Caching It caches the individual modules for efficient driving time. Here, the code reusability and DOM are focused. Which is the better option (Node js Vs React js)? Both Node.js vs React.js is modern technologies used by many successful companies. But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;

But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js?

Comparison between both the Node js and React js. Both React.js and Node.js are different technologies which will be used to develop different parts of any web app. Below, we compare React with Node js and the advantages and disadvantages. Node.js React.js It is Developed by Ryan Dahl Developed node js Jordan Walke, an employee of Facebook Type It is an open-source framework for writing codes and generating dynamic web pages. ReactJS is open-source and a client-side library used for delivering high-performance dynamic applications. Latest version 12.9.0 / 20 August 2019; 16.8.6 / 6 May 2019 Advantage It is very stretchable It and Used for web development. It is used for caching individual modules. Apps could be scaled horizontally or vertically both. We can convert the JavaScript code into Machine code by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an easy UI test case. It supports both Android and iOS as well. It provides server-side and front-end support. Code components would be reused. It is faster for debugging. It has a faster virtual DOM. Disadvantages It follows asynchronous programming in place of linear and blocking I/O (input/output) programming. The absence of a rich library. It is complex to learn JSX and JavaScript. Keeping up with the regular release of newer tools and technology is difficult for developers. Use cases Data streaming. It handles data streaming in real time. It is used to stream media, data from so many sources, uploading the files, and it is excellent for the Websockets server; API server. Node.js will handle many connections at a time. Therefore, it is suitable for API service. Microservices. Node.js is fast and easy. Thus, it is used to write microservices, such as an API gateway. Dynamic apps. It is perfect for projects with so many components, Like, such as changing mode frequently, the user logs in and accessing the permissions. Complex architecture. We choose React.js for building websites with a complex structure which is not easy to keep track of the traditional approach. As the application scales, React allows keeping track of every interaction. Popularity in the developer community 63,976 stars on the Github site. Here, 135,401 stars are on the Github site. Developer price per hour It is based on the Upwork information. The hourly rate for Node.js may vary: Basic back-end: $ 15-50 + Full Stack Developer: $ 30-150 + According to Upwork, hourly rates will vary as follows: Front-End: basic $ 15- $ 50, between $ 35- $ 100; Back-End: Basic $ 15- $ 50, Advanced $ 35- $ 100; Full-Stack Developer: $ 30 - $ 150.

But what do you choose for our suggested application? Let us give you a clue. If you want to create a scalable yet sophisticated server-side web application as an online streaming platform, then you can choose Node JS. React.js is better for creating the project with changing modes such as dynamic inputs, buttons and many other options. We can use both technologies for our web apps at the same time. You can create the web app's front end with the help of React and make the back end with the Node js, as Netflix did. Conclusion: When we create a server-side web application, like an online streaming platform, then Node.js will be an excellent framework. When you want to do a project with dynamic inputs and buttons, React.js is a better option. You can use both frameworks for a single project as well. The Node.js framework can be used to create the backend, while React.js will be used to create the front-end part. Netflix is an example of framework integration. Both frameworks have a significant and committed community. We hope that this article can clarify the differences between Node.js and React.js. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which is better: Node.js or React.js? As above discussed: Both Node.js and React.js have their use cases. They should be used together in a project. So it is not just making a comparison. Does React.js need Node.js? No, react.js does not need Node.js. React.js is frontend or backend? React.js is a front-end development application. Is Node.js easier than Java? It is similar to comparing apples to oranges. But it would be highlighted that Java is a comprehensive language and can justly be described as the tougher of the two.

Node.js Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they are different things. The primary difference between Node.js and React.js is that Node.js is a back-end framework, and React is used to develop user interfaces. But, they both have advantages and disadvantages with special use cases. Read if you want to know which one we have to use for our next JavaScript project. Below we see the features of Node.js and React.js and the pros and cons of both Node and React. We can decide which will suits our project best and according to the need after reading this article. Let's start. What is Node.js? Node.js is a multiplayer cross-platform runtime environment and an open-source platform that can be used to execute the JavaScript driver code of the browser. Most people are respected and understand that it is a brand or a programming language. Almost person Node.js for creating back-end services like API, web applications, or mobile applications. Node.js is a technology that can be used to build a back-end, which is used to use JavaScript. Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine powers Node.js. Node.js is an efficient and light-weighted technology because it is used as an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Developers use this framework for hosting the APIs, which serve the HTTP requests and access the database equally. Code: Below is an example which includes the HTTP module to building the servers. File name: App.js JavaScript 
var HTTP = requires('http');
 
// it creates the server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
{
 
    // it will write the response to the client
    res.write('JavaTpoint');
 
    // End the response
    res.end();
 
// The server object listens at port 8080
}).listen(8080);
 Output: Go to terminal and write the command to compile the nodejs file: node folder_name.js Now, open the localhost:8080 in the browser for output. Who uses Node.js? Node.js is used by famous clients and companies like Netflix, Trello, and Uber. Below, we explain why Node.js has become their framework of choice. The online video streaming leader, Netflix, conducts A/B testing to provide 93 million< users with a rich experience. The platform faces some issues with application stability and conditional dependencies. The company chose Node.js for its speed and lightness in solving these problems. In this way, Netflix reduced the start-up time by 70% more. Trello is an application of project management and uses server-side Node.js. The Trello team has found the Node good and useful for system updates that require many connections. Uber is a two-way carpooling service and said Node.js is the most crucial technological solution. The framework enables up scaling in line with the growing service demand. Node JS Key Features Now let's find out the main Node.js features. Open-source. Node.js is a completely free and open-source framework. Improved performance. Here, developers perform non-blocking operations that improve the web app's performance. Server development. Node.js has built-in APIs. It allows developers to create servers like DNS servers, TCP servers, HTTP servers, and many more. Unit test. Node.js has a device testing called Jasmine, which allows you to test clear code quickly. Scalability. The apps built by Node.js are scaled vertically and horizontally to improve their performance. What Is React.js? React.js is an open-source Javascript library used to develop user interfaces for websites and web apps in a structured way. React.js allows the development of a dynamic, high-performance library. For example, the technology displays news feeds while people chat. The alternatives to React js is Angular and Vue.js. It is efficient, declarative, and flexible and allows the creation of reusable UI components. It is mainly used in hard, interactive one-page web projects and responsive sites which are difficult to reuse. The virtual DOM algorithm from React is a time-consuming and inaccurate write code. A React application consists of components, each responsible for reproducing the small and reusable piece of HTML. Components are embedded in the components, allowing complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. Create a react project and edit the App.js file in the src folder like below: FilePath:- src/App.js: Javascript 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <>
          <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>
      </>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
 Output Who uses React.js? Facebook itself develops the react.js framework. React.js is used for content-based websites like "The New York Times" to apps like Twitter. Now let's check the apps that use this directory. Facebook is heavily dependent on user interaction with the website elements. Almost all the dynamic elements of any Facebook web app are built with React.js. Instagram is a good example of successful React use. The app will use React for Google Maps geolocation, APIs, and other features. Netflix uses React.js for its Gibbon platform. The platform uses low-performance TVs instead of DOMs used in web browsers. The React.js library is used for doing the Netflix team to improve the runtime performance, modularity, and speed of the site. React.js was handy for adding a dynamic online multicurrency calculator to a two-way marketplace. React.js main features Easy Maintenance. This library reuses the system components and resolves the issues with the updates. Performance. React uses the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that improves the performance of applications. Stable code. React guarantees the code stability and best performance of apps using the downward data flow. Developer Toolkit. React js provides the developers with troubleshooting and designing the tools, which ensures high performance. Mobile App Development. You can build a rich user interface for native apps supported by iOS and Android platforms by following the same design patterns. Now compare React and Node.js.
