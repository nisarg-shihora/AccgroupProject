Angular Material Tutorial Angular Material is a UI library component developed by Google in 2014. It is specially designed for AngularJS developers. It helps to design the application in a structured manner. Its components help to construct attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web applications. It is used to create a responsive and faster website. It attracts users and access the elements or components present in our application. It also helps to design our applications with unique styles and shapes. These components make the application or website more consistent and design responsive. It combines the classic principles of successful design with innovation and technology. Google developed Angular Material in 2014. At that time, it was tagged to AngularJS to make the applications more attractive and faster performance. Google wrote the code again from scratch and removed JS, then named it Angular Material in September 2016. UI/UX components are known as Angular Materials. Features of Angular Material It is an In-built responsive design. Angular Material has standard CSS. The new version of UI Components which are buttons, checkboxes, and text fields is used to follow Angular Material Design concepts. It has specialized features such as cards, toolbar, speed dial, side nav, swipe, side nav, and more. It is a cross-platform browser and it is used to create web components. Responsive Design Angular Material has a responsive design so that its website can fit in any size. The websites created by Material are compatible with Android, iPhone, tablets, and laptops. Extensible It is easy to add new CSS rules to overwrite the existing CSS It supports shadows and colors. The colors and shades are uniform in Angular Material. Angular Material is free to use. High quality Angular Material components are accessible for everyone. It is tested with many parameters that ensures performance and reliability of the application. It has straightforward APIs with consistent cross-platform behaviour. Versatile It provides tools that help developers to build their custom components with common patterns. It is customizable within the bounds. Frictionless It was built by the Angular team to integrate perfectly. We can use Angular Material to design a new application from scratch or in an existing application. AngularJS vs. Angular The Angular Material library is a stable product that is ready for use. Developers should note that AngularJS Material works with AngularJS 1.x. AngularJS 1.x is now in Long Term Support (LTS) mode. The Angular Material and Component Dev Kit (CDK) libraries (for Angular v2+) will be found in the Angular Components GitHub repository. Current development efforts are focused on accessibility, performance minor enhancements and bug fixes. The Latest Material Design The latest update of Material Design was announced at Google in May, 2018.
