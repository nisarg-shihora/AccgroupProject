Characteristics With ownership remaining with the employee, the new Act mandates that all companies contribute 6 percent (or more) of each employee's monthly salary to an individual labour pension account that is administered by the Bureau of Labor Insurance. A scheme for annuity insurance must be adopted by companies with 200 or more employees, and this decision must be made through the unions representing those workers. If there are no labour unions, a business organisation may purchase annuity insurance that complies with the Insurance Act on behalf of any employees who voluntarily desire to do so in writing, with the agreement of the central competent (the Ministry of Labor) and after a labor-management meeting. Employed persons to whom the Labor Standards Act applies (Taiwanese citizens; foreign spouses; spouses from mainland, Hong Kong, or Macau; and permanent resident foreigners).

In line with the Labor Pension Act, an employer who works or a worker or the appointed workers who are not covered by the Labor Standards Act may be eligible to make voluntary contributions and receive pension payments. Employees who choose to participate in the new pension system may start building up their pension accounts as their employers make contributions to them. The accounts are transferable and will be kept even if employees change employment or businesses close their doors or stop operating. Employers are required to offer severance payments based on a worker's employment seniority following the implementation of the new pension system, with time less than a year being computed proportionately and at a rate of half a month's compensation for every year of seniority. Six months of the average monthly earnings is the maximum amount of severance pay.

The Labor Pension Act states that the dividends accumulated from a worker's pension fund cannot be less than the dividends on a two-year fixed term deposit from a local bank. The National Treasury shall make up any shortfall in the event that accrued dividends fall short of that minimal rate. When a worker eventually receives their pension payments, in addition to the principal accumulated from all monthly contributions, they will also receive dividends equal to the interest paid on a two-year fixed term deposit from a bank. In the future, dividends from individual pension accounts may vary due to investment results in the financial markets, but with the guaranteed minimum rate.

All future monthly payments must be stopped if a worker who is already receiving payments on a monthly basis passes away before achieving the average life expectancy. Any residual funds in the individual pension account must be handed to the worker's dependents or survivors. Employers shall make monthly contributions to a pension account opened in the name of each employee that equals 6 percent (or more) of the employee's monthly salary.
