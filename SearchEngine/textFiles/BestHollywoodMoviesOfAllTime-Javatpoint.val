The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?

The top movies of all time list are particularly divisive, but all lists are meant to provoke discussion. No other creative medium has undergone such a radical transformation during the past 150 years. A great song will never lose its quality. A great melody never gets old, and a hot beat never gets old. In fact, young people today could like Harry Styles over The Beatles. A whole generation has probably grown accustomed to Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman since the release of The Dark Knight merely 14 years ago. In this ever-evolving collection, you may find everything from cult favorites to romantic comedies, and horror flicks to crime capers. Ranking the finest movies ever made is essentially impossible. But the list that most closely resembles a definitive ranking is one that is based on viewer's ratings. The list of the finest films ever produced on IMDb may be among the best of its kind in this regard. The list is created using the reviews of top films from millions of spectators. Despite the list being updated frequently, the top films haven't changed much throughout the years. Even if watching the newest movies is entertaining, it could occasionally be simpler to return to the timeless classics that everyone appears to like. The best Hollywood has to offer, international hits, movies from the twenty-first century, and films from decades before may all be found among IMDb's top-rated films. Of course, each moviegoer has a unique opinion of the top 10 movies of all time. Whether fans are rewatching an old favorite or catching up on a well-known film they have missed, this collection is a terrific place to look for the greatest movies of all time. The best picks are as follows: 1: The Godfather (1972) Despite being one of the most highly regarded movies ever made, The Godfather: Part II is not the best movie in the trilogy. The original has that honor. All crime families that emerged after The Godfather are descended from the Instances involved, from the sage characters of Goodfellas to The Sopranos: Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is the ultimate father of the Mafia genre. The operatic Mario Puzo adaption begins with a powerful sentence, "I believe in America," before Coppola's epic transforms into a terrifying deconstruction of the American dream. These moral conflicts are encapsulated in a legendary baptism sequence, which is masterfully edited in conjunction with the murder of four competing dons. The corruption-drenched drama follows a wealthy immigrant family as they struggle with the contradicting principles of authority and faith. The Godfather's authority endures thanks to several memorable details, including a severed horse head, Marlon Brando's breathy voice, and Nino Rota's infectious waltz. This is the tale of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia family that faces challenges in retaining control after the almost assassination of its patriarch. The movie combines violence with humor, intensity with emotion, and so much more. There is a tone of lines that are memorable and quotable. It's understandable why so many of today's top filmmakers regard it as such an inspirational movie. 2: The Dark Knight (2008) Most moviegoers may not hold much respect for the superhero genre, but Christopher Nolan's second Batman movie showed that they are capable of producing intelligent, grandiose, and exciting films. In The Dark Knight, Batman describes his frantic efforts to stop the Joker from destroying Gotham as he looks for someone to assume responsibility for defending the city. With its darker portrayal of the Caped Crusader, the movie has the air of a crime epic. The late Heath Leger's captivating portrayal as the anarchist Joker, however, is what most remember most about the movie. This is the standard that Matt Reeves' The Batman, a new Batman in gloomy Gotham, must surpass. The last act, which attempts to squeeze in nearly too many ideas and a lot of moral math, makes the middle installment of Christopher Nolan's Bat trilogy an almost flawless case study of how to make a smart superhero epic for modern audiences. Meanwhile, Heath Ledger's Joker redefines villainy on the big screen: You now need a party trick in addition to being sinister. Making a serious, interesting, and successful comic book movie is the challenge Nolan has set for himself. Although difficult, the goal is noble. The action of "The Dark Knight" is magnificent, it grounds its acrobatics in its world, and even when its ideas are obscured by noise, it never loses its sense of relevance. 3: The Lord Of The Rings (ALL PARTS) J.R.R. Tolkien's epic book The Lord of the Rings was first released in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1957). The Lord of the Rings tells the story of a band of somewhat reticent heroes who set out to defend their world against absolute evil. Its numerous realms and creatures were derived from Tolkien's broad philological and folkloric expertise. Frodo Baggins is given a mystical Ring of Invisibility by his uncle Bilbo when he is 33 years old, which is the hobbit equivalent of maturity. A Christ-like character named Frodo realizes that the ring has the ability to corrupt its wearer as well as govern the entire universe. The ring is intended to be destroyed by being thrown into the crack of doom, where it was produced, by a group of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men. They are opposed to their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders. Both monetarily and critically, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002, 2003), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) were huge hits. A record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, went to the third movie. 4: Pulp Fiction (1994) One of the most well-known directors of all time is Quentin Tarantino. He influenced a generation of filmmakers with his distinctive voice, vast film knowledge, and propensity for fusing funny comedy with shocking violence. It's difficult to contest the fact that many consider Pulp Fiction to be his best work. What's the finest aspect of Pulp Fiction? The Jack Rabbit Slim's twist competition? The Gimp vs. Bruce Willis Ezekiel 25:17, Jules' monologue? Quentin Tarantino's film draws curiosity with its grabby cinematic moments but achieves all-time status with its hypnotic achronological narrative, outrageously quotable dialogue, and proper comprehension of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is a flourish of '90s indie attitude that still feels new despite a legion of talkative imitators, marking its generation as profoundly as Star Wars did before it. The movie swings back and forth between a variety of underground storylines in Los Angeles. Tarantino gives well-known criminal stories his own distinctive spin. The movie has great music and is surprising and fast-paced with endlessly quote-worthy language. Though frequently imitated, never matched. 5: Star Wars (1977) Star Wars is an American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Star Wars is still the film that launched what is probably the most well-known film franchise of all time, despite not always being regarded as the greatest in the series. The film created its iconic figure, introduced viewers to a galaxy far, far away, and launched the epic journey. Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date in terms of science fiction, but these criticisms are insignificant in comparison to the movie's greatest accomplishment, nearly 50 years after it was first imagined, pulp space fiction is finally portrayed as a fully viable movie genre. It's like viewing the first Western to feature actual exteriors, with the exception of 2001, which isn't a genre film. And audiences have a legitimate sense that they have been owed this for a while. Even though Star Wars has some clear shortcomings, the current trend toward spectacle and wonder in the film is quite positive. 6: Seven Samurai (1954) The impact of Akira Kurosawa on Hollywood filmmakers cannot be overstated, and his film Seven Samurai is probably the most influential of all. The film has received numerous homages for its cinematic approach in addition to being turned into Western films like The Magnificent Seven. You'll never sit through 207 minutes of the film easier than this. Akira Kurosawa creates a masterfully rendered epic that is at once engrossing, humorous, and exhilarating on the most basic of plots-an impoverished farming village pools its money to hire samurai to guard them against the ruthless bandits who steal its produce. The final clash in the rain is unforgettable, but this is actually a study of human strengths and flaws. Of course, the action sequences stir the blood. While Takashi Shimura's Yoda-like commander provides the movie with its emotional core, Toshiro Mifune is excellent as the half-crazed self-styled samurai. The original has been remade numerous times, including in the Wild West (The Magnificent Seven), space (Battle Beyond the Stars), and even with animated insects (A Bug's Life). It is undoubtedly among the best action films of all time and is still exhilarating to watch decades later. 7: Seven (1995) With the suspenseful serial killer film Seven, David Fincher solidified his place in Hollywood. It is a movie with a terrible enough idea to frighten viewers. However, the stunning and intense story that was in store for the audience caught them off guard. The most recognizable filmmaker of his time is David Fincher; he is known for creating memorable music videos and dramas like Zodiac and The Social Network that helped shape the decade. However, he had a difficult time adjusting to Hollywood because the city hardly recognized him. Seven, the first scene in which Fincher's terrifying vision appeared unfiltered, was a turning point. Style-wise, the gloomy film (shot by a brilliant Darius Khondji using a silver-nitrate-retention method) has endured longer than even The Silence of the Lambs, yet audiences are still shaken by that easily meme-able sucker punch of a conclusion. As two homicide investigators on the hunt for a killer who kills his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the lead roles. With one of the most startling conclusions in Hollywood history, it is an eerie and atmospheric criminal procedural. 8: Goodfellas (1990) Although Martin Scorsese has produced a number of gangster films throughout the course of his career, many consider Goodfellas to be his finest work. It tells the true tale of Henry Hill, portrayed by the late Ray Liotta, who rose to prominence inside a powerful and risky criminal family. I've always wanted to be a mobster, ever since I can remember. The opening line of Ray Liotta is the crime film equivalent of "Once upon a time...," and what follows is Martin Scorsese's retelling of a fairy tale about a starry-eyed Brooklyn youth who realizes his boyhood ambition but ultimately turns out to be a schnook. Goodfellas, which is based on the real-life of mobster Henry Hill, was created in The Godfather's wake, but as time passes, the debate over whether the film is more impactful largely comes down to generation. Due to its fast-paced two and a half hours (and three decades), the former is undoubtedly more enjoyable to watch again. It's also oddly relatable for a movie about vicious professional criminals. Scorsese's gangsters are more blue-collar than Coppola's, who delved inside the one percent of organized crime. Working for the mafia turns out to be very similar to working at any other job; you spend 30 years busting your hump to climb the ladder just to land face down on a bloodied carpet in some gaudy suburbia house. 9: Interstellar (2014) Christopher Nolan enjoys a fan base that is second to none. Although Interstellar did not receive as much praise from critics or garner as much money as some of Nolan's earlier films, many fans still think it is one of the greatest films ever made. There is no denying that Interstellar was one of the decade's most intellectually stimulating movies. As a result, many people were perplexed by the Interstellar story, high-concept physics, and daring conclusions. In the movie, Matthew McConaughey plays a man who reluctantly abandons his family to go on a space expedition in search of a planet that is habitable for humans. Many consider Interstellar to be a modern sci-fi masterpiece because of its amazing cinematography, intricate plot, and excellent acting. 10: Life Is Beautiful (1997) It is quite challenging for a movie to incorporate humor and an upbeat tone inside a narrative that simultaneously has sadness and heartbreak. But Life is Beautiful succeeded in doing that in the eyes of many fans, which accounts for the film's widespread appeal. A Jewish open-minded waiter utilizes the ideal combination of will, humor, and creativity to shield his son from the perils surrounding their camp as they become victims of the Holocaust. A carefree Jewish waiter named Guido begins a fairytale existence in 1930s Italy by wooing and wedding a beautiful woman from a neighboring city. Up until German forces occupied Italy, Guido and his wife were content together and had a son. Guido imagines the Holocaust as a game, with a tank as the final prize, in an effort to keep his family together and help his son endure the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp. The Italian film, written, produced, and starring Roberto Benigni, is about a Jewish father who is optimistic and his son who is a victim of the Holocaust during World War II. The father goes to great pains to persuade his kid that all that is happening is just one huge game. Next TopicBest Korean Movies ? prev next ?
