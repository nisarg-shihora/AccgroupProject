These algorithms determine the rankings of the SERPs based on various ranking factors. However, it gives more emphasis on certain metrics to evaluate the quality of a page and accordingly to decide its ranking. Key Metrics Used by Search Engines: Links: The links from other sites are called backlinks. These links help in determining the ranking of a site in SERPs. A link is considered as a vote of quality from other websites, as a website owner would not link to a site that is of poor quality. Content: The quality of content is also a vital parameter in determining the ranking of a site. The content should be unique, relevant for the given search query. Page Structure: The web pages are written in HTML; the html coding of a page is also used by search engines to evaluate a page.
