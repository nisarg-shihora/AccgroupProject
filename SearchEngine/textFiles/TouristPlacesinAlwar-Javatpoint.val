Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year. Here is a list of tourist places that can be relished in this small yet beautiful place- 1.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year. Here is a list of tourist places that can be relished in this small yet beautiful place- 1. Bhangarh Fort Bhangarh fort is located amidst the Aravalli range, and it falls on the border of Sariska reserve. This Fort city is famous for its historical ruins and the legends of ghosts. Bhangarh is popularly viewed as one of the spookiest places in the entire country. Bhangarh Fort is a 17th Century fort located in Rajasthan's Alwar district. Bhagwant Das constructed it in honour of the son of his Madho Singh I. Later on, Madho Singh named this fort 'Bhangarh' after his grandfather's name- Man Singh or Bhan Singh.

The tomb is named after the queen probably because she committed 'Sati' (self-immolation) on her husband's pyre, which was considered heroic and brave in those times. However, the practice of 'Sati' was abolished later. This epic monument is located next to the Alwar Museum. Its interior is covered with mythological paintings, carved floral patterns and frescos. In Rajput architecture, Chhatris are commonly used to depict honour and pride. There is no entry fee at this place.

His immense love for architecture, detail and design can be seen in the Tomb of Fateh Jang. It speaks highly of his virtuosity.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year. Here is a list of tourist places that can be relished in this small yet beautiful place- 1. Bhangarh Fort Bhangarh fort is located amidst the Aravalli range, and it falls on the border of Sariska reserve. This Fort city is famous for its historical ruins and the legends of ghosts. Bhangarh is popularly viewed as one of the spookiest places in the entire country. Bhangarh Fort is a 17th Century fort located in Rajasthan's Alwar district. Bhagwant Das constructed it in honour of the son of his Madho Singh I. Later on, Madho Singh named this fort 'Bhangarh' after his grandfather's name- Man Singh or Bhan Singh.

The tomb is named after the queen probably because she committed 'Sati' (self-immolation) on her husband's pyre, which was considered heroic and brave in those times. However, the practice of 'Sati' was abolished later. This epic monument is located next to the Alwar Museum. Its interior is covered with mythological paintings, carved floral patterns and frescos. In Rajput architecture, Chhatris are commonly used to depict honour and pride. There is no entry fee at this place.

His immense love for architecture, detail and design can be seen in the Tomb of Fateh Jang. It speaks highly of his virtuosity.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year.

Its ancient name was Salva or Salwa, based on the tribal community that inhabited the region; it was a part of the Matsya Kingdom. The Matya Kingdom was one of the 16 Mahajanpadas. Alwar is where the mighty heroes of the Mahabharata, the Pandavas, spent the final years of their 13-year banishment. Over time, Alwar was ruled by different Rajput clans, including the Nikumbh, the Khanzada Rajput, the Badgujar Rajput, and the Naruka (Kachwaha) Rajputs. The region was also ruled by Marathas for a brief period, after which it went under the control of the Mughals. Alwar was established as a princely state in the colonial era by a Kachwaha Rajput, Pratap Singh. From 1770 onwards till independence, it remained under the control of the Britishers. Following the independence of India in 1947, it acceded to the Republic of India. Later, it was incorporated into the National Capital Region (NCR) to accelerate its development. The present-day Alwar echoes its rich historical past and has become a popular tourist spot in the country. It flaunts its various forts, palaces and lakes from an epoch long gone, attracting lacs of people every year. Here is a list of tourist places that can be relished in this small yet beautiful place- 1. Bhangarh Fort Bhangarh fort is located amidst the Aravalli range, and it falls on the border of Sariska reserve. This Fort city is famous for its historical ruins and the legends of ghosts. Bhangarh is popularly viewed as one of the spookiest places in the entire country. Bhangarh Fort is a 17th Century fort located in Rajasthan's Alwar district. Bhagwant Das constructed it in honour of the son of his Madho Singh I. Later on, Madho Singh named this fort 'Bhangarh' after his grandfather's name- Man Singh or Bhan Singh. Entering through the main gate of this ruined Fort will give you an eerie vibe; at the same time, your curiosity to explore the place will also escalate. You can find temples like Hanuman Temple, Gopinath Temple, Someshwar Temple, and Havelis and palaces inside the fort premises. There are numerous Hindu temples located at the entrance to the gate. The Palace of the royal family is situated near the limit within the Fort. The tale of the beautiful princess Ratnawati will surely capture your attention, but for that, you'll have to visit the place. People say her soul still wanders around the place! Perhaps, that's why the timings are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entry fee of Bhangarh fort For Foreigners: Rs. 200/- For Indians: Rs.25/- Video Camera fees: Rs.200/- 2. Bala Quila Fort Bala Quila Fort, also known as the Alwar Fort, is located in the Aravalli ranges. Its construction took place in the 15th Century under Hasan Khan Mewati. Since then, it has been administrated by various kingdoms, including the Marathas, the Yadavas, and the Kachwaha Rajputs. 'Bala Quila' translates to 'Young Fort'. The only metalled road connecting the fort to the city of Alwar is the 'Laxman Pole'. Silver pages in history declare that Pratap Singh, the founder of the Alwar state, could only enter the Fort via this route. In 1775, A.D. Kachhwaha Rajput Pratap Singh seized the Fort and established the city of Alwar. The Fort is situated on a cliff with an elevation of 300 m providing a magnificent panorama of the Alwar city. The entry fee is Rs. 10/- for Indian adults, Rs. 5/- for Indian children and Rs. 100/- for foreigners. It is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on all days of the week. 3. Siliserh Lake Palace Siliserh Lake Palace is situated on the border of Siliserh lake, a serene water body overlooking the mountain range of Aravalli. This impressive tourist attraction is spread over an area of 7 square kilometres. Alwar was once a Rajput state that was previously named Mewat. This stunning palace was built in 1845 by the ruler of Alwar, Maharaja Vinay Singh, along the banks of Siliserh Lake for his beloved wife, Shila. This Palace was initially constructed as a lodge for the royal family for hunting purposes and for residing. Later, it was transformed into a palace. Siliserh Lake is a renowned place to picnic in the region. Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) recently transformed it into a heritage hotel. Activities like boating and fishing draw a large crowd. Peak season can give you a glimpse of some beautiful birds that migrate here. It is located 16 kilometres from Alwar city and is easily accessible. It is a great place to cool off Rajasthan's summer heat! 4. Sariska National Park Sariska National Park, or the Sariska Tiger Reserve, is spread over an area of 881 square kilometres, covered with deciduous forests, cliffs, grasslands and rocky landscapes. In the past, the Maharaja of Alwar used this place as his hunting ground. After the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act in 1972 and Project Tiger in 1973, this region was declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1958 and a National Park in 1982. It is mainly home to the endangered species of Royal Bengal Tigers. Still, a variety of other animals, including leopard, sambhar, chital, nilgai, four-horned antelope, hyena, and jungle cats, can be found here. Out of the total 211 bird species that have been recorded in reserve, 120 are residents, 73 are migrants, and 18 are considered to be vagrants. Peafowl, white-rumped vulture, grey francolin, Aravalli red spurfowl, painted spurfowl etc, make up the avian population of this region.

On the one hand, is the Sankat Mochan Vir Hanuman Mandir, and on the other, Sayyed Darbar. There is no wall separation between the two. One can hear the air filled with soothing Bhajans on Thursday mornings while the evenings mesmerise everyone with Qawwalis. The fragrances of camphor, ghee and lobaan are infused together. The unfurling of Saffron, Green and Tricolour flags together reminds everyone of how there is strength in unity. It is indeed a delightful sight!

Vinay Vilas Mahal is home to an elevated pavilion shaped like a door which illustrates the Rajput kingdoms' pride and honour. The ground floor is currently used as the office for governmental purposes.

The total time to explore this place is about 1-2 hours. Although there is no entry fee, one needs prior permission from the Maharaja of Alwar, who resides in New Delhi. 9. Rani Moosi Ki Chhatri It is Raja Bakhtawar Singh and Rani Moosi's cenotaph. With its graceful sandstone formations and canopies made of white marble, it sets a wonderful example of 19th-century Rajputana architecture. It was built in 1815 by Vinay Singh as a tribute to the late king and his queen. The tomb is named after the queen probably because she committed 'Sati' (self-immolation) on her husband's pyre, which was considered heroic and brave in those times. However, the practice of 'Sati' was abolished later. This epic monument is located next to the Alwar Museum. Its interior is covered with mythological paintings, carved floral patterns and frescos. In Rajput architecture, Chhatris are commonly used to depict honour and pride. There is no entry fee at this place. The time required to explore the entire place is about 30 minutes, and the timings are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 10.

We all know the splendid monuments built by Shah Jahan during his thirty-year as the Mughal Emperor, including the Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Jama Masjid. His immense love for architecture, detail and design can be seen in the Tomb of Fateh Jang. It speaks highly of his virtuosity. This five-storeyed building is an amalgamation of Indo-Islamic and Rajputana design. The actual tomb is situated in the centre of the monument amidst beautiful gardens.
