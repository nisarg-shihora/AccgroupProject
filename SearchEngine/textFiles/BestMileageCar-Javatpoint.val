A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same.

The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment).

This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque.

A car's mileage is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not it will be the first choice because it opens up the possibility of using the vehicle for business purposes too. Additionally, fuel efficiency is unquestionably an essential component. So, if you are looking for a vehicle with the best mileage, the following list will help you narrow your search. These vehicles are among the best in their class and won't strain your finances. 1. Hyundai Venue Sport utility vehicles or SUVs are not particularly well-known for their remarkable fuel economy, but this is not the case with the Hyundai Venue. The Hyundai Venue has astoundingly good fuel efficiency estimates, ranging from 18.15 to 23.7 kilometers per litre. This has helped the brand become a runaway success in the lucrative sub-four-meter SUV class. The Venue may have arrived on the scene a little too late, but it is loaded with various contemporary engine choices. The first car has a direct-injection 1.0-liter GDI engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine is paired to the transmission by default. This vehicle's engine and gearbox combination achieve a fuel economy rating of 18.27 kilometers per liter. Thus, making Venue the most fuel-efficient gasoline-powered SUV available in India. The powertrain system achieves ARAI-rated fuel consumption of 18.15 kmpl when coupled with a 7-speed automatic dual-clutch gearbox. This is quite a respectable statistic for an automatic petrol-powered SUV. It is significant to note that Hyundai does not provide an automatic transmission option for the 1.2-liter petrol engine option in the Venue. According to the manufacturer, the fuel economy of the petrol-powered Venue 1.2 is a decent 17.52 kilometers per litre. It is the 1.4-liter CRDi engine that is responsible for the Venue's exceptional fuel economy. The Hyundai Venue is undoubtedly worthy of being rated first as the best mileage SUV in India that costs less than 10 lakhs. This recognition is well deserved. 2. Honda City E: Hev The new City e: HEV hybrid model that Honda has developed specifically for the Indian market was recently made public. It is said that the new model would have a certified fuel economy of 26.5kmpl, which would place it in second place among the most fuel-efficient cars in India (Petrol Segment). The new City e: HEV is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson Cycle petrol engine with four cylinders and naturally aspirated combustion, and it is teamed with two electric motors. The electric motor produces 109 horsepower and 253 newton-meters of torque from a standstill, whereas the petrol engine is rated at 98 horsepower and 127 newton-meters of torque. The lithium-ion battery in the City Hybrid has a capacity of 0.734 kWh and weighs 14.5 kg. This variant only comes with one gear ratio that is always the same. There are three driving modes: Engine Drive, EV Drive, and Hybrid Drive. Engine Drive runs only on the petrol engine, while EV Drive runs solely on the electric motors, and Hybrid runs on a combination of both. 3. Mahindra XUV300 The Mahindra XUV300 is equipped with a stylish exterior design, an interior that is packed with features, and fuel-efficient engines. According to the ARAI test cycle results, the petrol model of the Mahindra XUV300 is said to have a fuel economy of 17.0 kmpl, while the diesel model is said to have a fuel mileage value of 20 kmpl. This vehicle was designed specifically for the current consumers in India. The engine of the Mahindra XUV300 has been fine-tuned to roll out the highest performance and fuel efficiency statistics possible. The start-stop system is designed to automatically switch off the engine when it is not being used to prevent the unnecessary use of petrol. The car's sixth gear was developed specifically to reduce fuel consumption in addition to its other functions. It is possible that it will make the engine spin more slowly when you are cruising at high speeds on the highway, which will help you save a significant amount of money on fuel consumption. Under the bonnet of the Mahindra XUV300 are two engine choices: a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol motor that generates 110 BHP and 200-newton meters of torque, while the other is a 1.5-liter turbo-diesel mill that generates 115 BHP and 300 newton-meters of peak torque. Both of these engines are turbocharged. The XUV300 is equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission as the standard gearbox; however, a 6-speed automatic transmission is available as an option for the diesel engine. 4. Tata Nexon The Tata Nexon is undeniably one of the most attractive automobiles available in its price range. Nevertheless, you might not be aware that the Tata Nexon is also one of the most fuel-efficient cars in the Indian market.

Honda City 1.5 E MT The Honda City 1.5 E MT is the entry-level petrol model in the lineup of Honda City automobiles. It is driven by a 1497 cc, 1.5-litre petrol engine that is capable of producing 119 PS of maximum power at 6600 rpm and 146 Nm of peak torque at 4600 rpm. The engine is powered by petrol. The Honda City 1.5 E MT strikes the ideal balance between luxury and performance while maintaining exceptional mileage. A five-speed manual transmission gearbox is responsible for transferring power from the engine to the front wheels of the hatchback. Additionally, this engine achieves an exceptional fuel economy of 16.8 kilometers per litre. It features a fuel tank that has a capacity of 40 liters and an overall curb weight of 1165 kilograms. The Honda City 1.5 E MT has a maximum speed of 171 kilometers per hour. This motor vehicle can be purchased in India for a price of 8.21lakh Indian rupees.

It is propelled by a 1.6-liter petrol motor and a 1582 cc engine, both of which produce 123PS of power and 151Nm of torque, respectively.

In addition to that, there is a sophisticated entertainment and communication setup in the vehicle. 9.

When we think about the factors that have contributed to the success of the Vitara Brezza, the car's excellent gas mileage stands out as particularly significant. The redesigned 2020 Maruti Vitara Brezza will continue to provide an astoundingly high degree of fuel economy, despite the changes that have been made to the vehicle.
