CRM(Customer Relationship Management) CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, a software to manage all the customer and company's interactions.

It is an integrated CRM platform that provides a single shared view of each customer for all the departments within an organization, such as Marketing, Sales, Commerce, and Service. Our salesforce tutorial is designed to help beginners with the Salesforce and professionals' basic concepts with advanced concepts. In this, we will cover all the essential topics of Salesforce from beginning to Apex development. What is Salesforce? Salesforce is a SaaS or Software as a Service, which means there is no need to install the software or server to work on. Users can simply sign-up in Salesforce.com and can start running the business instantly. It was founded by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez in 1999. Salesforce was started as a CRM software, but today it provides various products and software solutions to users and developers. Since Salesforce is cloud-based software, hence it does not require any IT professional to set up anything. It provides one of the best ways to connect with customers, business partners, and clients over the single integrated environment. It allows the businesses to identify the customer's requirements, address the problems easily, and provide the same solution in the minimum timeframe. Before going in deep with this tutorial, let's understand two basic concepts of Salesforce, CRM and Cloud Computing. CRM(Customer Relationship Management) CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, a software to manage all the customer and company's interactions. It contains and manages all the customer-related information such as Customer Name, Address, Phone Number, Email address, and other business-related information. The software keeps all the interactions done with customers, complaints registered by the customer, resolutions provided by the executive, and other customer activities with the particular business or product. It also allows us to track and manage the sales, marketing, and prospects given to customers. Cloud-Computing Cloud computing is a technology to store, manage, process, and access the internet instead of a local server or computer hard drives. With the help of cloud computing, an organization can save lots of cost to local storage of data, maintenance of data, etc. The information over the Cloud can be accessed much efficiently and from anywhere, with the help of the internet. Using cloud computing instead of traditional storage helps users with lots of benefits such as speed, cost-effectiveness, security, global access, etc. Note: In the next topic, we will learn a detailed introduction of Cloud computing. History of Salesforce Below are some milestones that occurred in the evolution of the Salesforce over the years from its beginning: The salesforce development was started in 1999 by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Frank Dominguez, and Dave Moellenhoff, developers with the same vision of Salesforce's CRM.

Salesforce Tutorial Salesforce is one of the best cloud-based CRM platforms. It is an integrated CRM platform that provides a single shared view of each customer for all the departments within an organization, such as Marketing, Sales, Commerce, and Service. Our salesforce tutorial is designed to help beginners with the Salesforce and professionals' basic concepts with advanced concepts. In this, we will cover all the essential topics of Salesforce from beginning to Apex development. What is Salesforce? Salesforce is a SaaS or Software as a Service, which means there is no need to install the software or server to work on. Users can simply sign-up in Salesforce.com and can start running the business instantly. It was founded by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez in 1999. Salesforce was started as a CRM software, but today it provides various products and software solutions to users and developers. Since Salesforce is cloud-based software, hence it does not require any IT professional to set up anything. It provides one of the best ways to connect with customers, business partners, and clients over the single integrated environment. It allows the businesses to identify the customer's requirements, address the problems easily, and provide the same solution in the minimum timeframe. Before going in deep with this tutorial, let's understand two basic concepts of Salesforce, CRM and Cloud Computing. CRM(Customer Relationship Management) CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, a software to manage all the customer and company's interactions. It contains and manages all the customer-related information such as Customer Name, Address, Phone Number, Email address, and other business-related information. The software keeps all the interactions done with customers, complaints registered by the customer, resolutions provided by the executive, and other customer activities with the particular business or product. It also allows us to track and manage the sales, marketing, and prospects given to customers. Cloud-Computing Cloud computing is a technology to store, manage, process, and access the internet instead of a local server or computer hard drives. With the help of cloud computing, an organization can save lots of cost to local storage of data, maintenance of data, etc. The information over the Cloud can be accessed much efficiently and from anywhere, with the help of the internet. Using cloud computing instead of traditional storage helps users with lots of benefits such as speed, cost-effectiveness, security, global access, etc. Note: In the next topic, we will learn a detailed introduction of Cloud computing. History of Salesforce Below are some milestones that occurred in the evolution of the Salesforce over the years from its beginning: The salesforce development was started in 1999 by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Frank Dominguez, and Dave Moellenhoff, developers with the same vision of Salesforce's CRM.

Our salesforce tutorial is designed to help beginners with the Salesforce and professionals' basic concepts with advanced concepts.

Salesforce is a SaaS or Software as a Service, which means there is no need to install the software or server to work on. Users can simply sign-up in Salesforce.com and can start running the business instantly. It was founded by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez in 1999. Salesforce was started as a CRM software, but today it provides various products and software solutions to users and developers. Since Salesforce is cloud-based software, hence it does not require any IT professional to set up anything.

It allows the businesses to identify the customer's requirements, address the problems easily, and provide the same solution in the minimum timeframe. Before going in deep with this tutorial, let's understand two basic concepts of Salesforce, CRM and Cloud Computing. CRM(Customer Relationship Management) CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, a software to manage all the customer and company's interactions. It contains and manages all the customer-related information such as Customer Name, Address, Phone Number, Email address, and other business-related information. The software keeps all the interactions done with customers, complaints registered by the customer, resolutions provided by the executive, and other customer activities with the particular business or product. It also allows us to track and manage the sales, marketing, and prospects given to customers. Cloud-Computing Cloud computing is a technology to store, manage, process, and access the internet instead of a local server or computer hard drives. With the help of cloud computing, an organization can save lots of cost to local storage of data, maintenance of data, etc. The information over the Cloud can be accessed much efficiently and from anywhere, with the help of the internet.
