The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie.

The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs.

However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies.

Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well.

Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8.

The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga.

Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5.

The Arabian Sea forms its western coast, and it is bordered to the north by the district of North Goa, to the east and south by the district of Uttara Kannada in the state of Karnataka. If you want some alone time or a calm walk on the beach or through the streets, south Goa is the ideal place for you. South Goa is the destination to visit if you seek tranquility and stunning scenery. The best undeveloped, uninhabited, and unspoiled beaches in South Goa provide tranquil surroundings, leisure, and natural beauty. So here is a list of some of the very famous Tourist Places in South Goa. 1. Cavelossim Beach The Cavelossim Beach lies in South Goa and features spectacular black rocks that contrast with the white sand coastlines of this picturesque beach. For tourists wishing to enjoy the seemingly limitless length of the crystal blue waves, Cavelossim is the ideal location. It is nicer and more peaceful than the clichéd party beaches of Goa. Major activities in this area include swimming, sunbathing, and spotting dolphins. Cavelossim Beach is located between the Sal River to the east and the clear Arabian Sea to the west. It offered water sports like jet skiing, speed boating, windsurfing, parasailing, and boating excursions. The majority of the beautiful beaches and cafes have sun loungers that are ideal for unwinding. Ayurvedic treatments are provided nearby for anyone seeking to unwind after a stressful day at work, and the road leading to the beach is filled with charming little gift and souvenir shops. 2. Cola Beach One of the best-kept secrets in South Goa is Cola Beach, also called "Khola" Beach. The golden-sand beach in the Canacona area is dotted with volcanic stones. The beach lies off the usual route, concealed by heavily overgrown hills, and requires a fair amount of rugged terrain to be climbed before reaching this unspoiled beauty. As a result, the beach does not get a lot of visitors. Sunbathers will love Cola Beach because of this. A tiny hill separates North Cola Beach from South Cola, which are both parts of Cola Beach. A river connects the two in the center, known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lagoon for its crystal-clear green hue. Swimming in this area is ideal due to the calm sea. Cola Beach also has breathtaking sunsets thanks to the beach's unique ability to reflect the sun's beams. Cola Beach has a fairly small number of shacks, and the majority of the restaurants are found inside the resorts. 3. Patnem Beach Patnem Beach, one of Goa's most remote and serene beaches, is located near Canacona, South Goa. It's the ideal location for unwinding by the beach and doing nothing. As an alternative, you can enroll in one of the several yoga retreats and instructor training programs at the local institutions providing the same. Swimming in the seas is relatively safe, and there are unobstructed, breathtaking views of the sunset. Patnem Beach is the ideal substitute for those seeking a less crowded beach than North Goa's well-liked beaches because it provides a relaxing, opulent beach experience without excluding any of Goa's must-see attractions. The lengthy Patnem Beach coastline is dotted with shacks and little homes. Don't forget to sample the regional seafood specialties and traditional Goan dishes like Vindaloo, Chamuca, or the delicious Fried Fish. The Patnem seashore is lined with cute houses and shacks. These offer a variety of cuisines, including Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and scrumptious original Goan food, as well as wonderful unique seafood. There are numerous cafes, eateries, and neighborhood shacks along the long expanse of the sandy beach. The Sea Front Restaurant and Bar, Papayas, and Nirvana Cafe are a few of the more well-known options. The quickest and least expensive method to go to Patnem Beach is to take a state transport bus from the Margao Bus Station. The trip should take no more than an hour. The Canacona train station is the closest station to you. From the station, you can rent an auto rickshaw to take you to Patnem Beach. You might have to switch buses at the Kadamba Bus Stand, though. 4. Kuskem Waterfall One of South Goa's least visited attractions is Kuskem Waterfall, which is tucked away in the charming neighborhood of Canacona. The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is only around 20 kilometers distant from this area, which is renowned for its untainted beauty. It is a seasonal waterfall; thus, the monsoon season is the best time to visit. The water body gurgles amidst luxuriant vegetation. Although it is not a huge waterfall, it has impressive quality. Additionally, Kuskem Waterfall in Canacona has grown to become a popular eco-tourism destination during the past few years. The Kuskem Waterfall is frequently visited by tourists that travel to Canacona to view the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. One must enter Hathipal's sanctuary in order to get to the location. The waterfall is around 20 km far and is in plain sight. It is impossible to overlook the sight of milky-white water rushing through the lush greenery. The fall, which is around 30 meters deep and has a source tucked away in the highlands that only restock during the rainy season, is entirely natural. The ideal time to visit Canacona's Kuskem Waterfall is between June and October, which is essentially the whole monsoon season. Only during the monsoons, when the periodic rains feed the river's water upstream, does the waterfall get refilled each year. Having said that, visitors should be warned that June and July are the wettest months of the year in Goa, where there is an average annual rainfall of 650 mm. If one does not enjoy monsoons, this can make the trip a little inconvenient, but if they do, the experience might be thrilling. 5. Butterfly Beach The Butterfly Beach is located in Goa's Cancona district, a few kilometers south of Palolem. This beach is also referred to as Honeymoon Beach. It is in the shape of a tiny cove that is bordered by tall trees. The butterfly beach, one of Goa's most remote and little-visited beaches, is typically only reachable via boat (ferry) from other surrounding beaches, which only adds to its allure. Since there are no roads leading directly to Butterfly Beach, getting there by land requires a difficult journey through a jungle. However, this also presents a fantastic chance to go jungle trekking! It's interesting that Butterfly Beach got its name since the trees in the area periodically draw a variety of butterflies. Perhaps it's because the beach itself is shaped like a butterfly! In either case, it is equally attractive, especially around sunset. The beach has a distinctive and beautiful setting with a path that leads to the open sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. One of the rare sites in Goa to see playful dolphins is Butterfly Beach. When it rains heavily, it is best to avoid going to the beach because boat excursions are frequently unavailable. Take the Agonda beach road first if you're taking a cab or a car from Agonda. A walking path on this road leads to Butterfly beach, which is located 0.8 kilometers from Tina Beach Resort. If you're taking the Palolem to Agonda Beach Road, the trek's beginning point is 1.5 kilometers after you pass the Leopard Valley Club. Vehicles cannot continue past this point. The trip from here is said to be 2 kilometers long and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. The trekking path is marked with markers that will safely guide you through the jungle to the beach. Additionally, having a GPS will make finding your way about easier. 6. Tambdi Surla Temple The Mahadev Temple is another name for Tambdi Surla. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Tambdi Surla is a Shaivite temple from the 12th century. The temple, which is made completely of black basalt and is one of the oldest in Goa, has a stunning architectural design. A magnificent Shiva linga and a headless bull idol can be found in the inner sanctuary. A further feature that adds to the area's appeal and natural beauty is that River Surla flanks the temple. The innermost sanctum of the temple is presided over by a magnificent Shiva Linga. Additionally, according to a local tradition, a large snake is still said to dwell in the temple's shadowy crevices. Inside the building are a Garba griha, antarala, and a Nandi mandapa with a headless sculpture of Nandi (vehicle of Lord Shiva). The roof of this Jain-style building is anchored by four pillars with elaborate elephant carvings that rest on Ashokan lotus blossoms. The temple also features exquisite panels that are decorated with sculptures of Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, as well as their consorts. A three-tiered tower supports the inner sanctuary of the mandap, and the mandap is covered in sloping roofing. The Kadamba Empire, complete with elephants and horsemen, is depicted in one of these columns as well. The most significant event at Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is Mahashivratri, which is observed there with much fanfare. Several pilgrims and visitors, in addition to the locals, also attend the temple on this occasion. The Tambdi Surla Mahadev Temple is located 70 kilometers from Goa's airport. The closest railway line is located in Kulem, 21 kilometers from the temple. Buses often run and travel to and from nearby places, dropping off passengers at their destinations. 7. Rajbagh Beach The Rajbagh Beach, which takes its name from the well-known Rajbagh Residency close to the shore, has long taken pleasure in being one of Goa's greatest and cleanest beaches. The beach, which is in South Goa, has a captivating 1-kilometer-long shoreline and provides a relaxing beach experience. It is one of South Goa's most beautiful coasts and is situated in the Canacona region. The distance to the Rajbagh beach, starting from the southernmost point of the Patnem beach, is only 1.5 kilometers. It is located 3.5 kilometers south of South Goa's well-known Palolem Beach in the Canacona region. The beach is located 45 miles from Margao, Goa's cultural center. Despite having a relatively undeveloped coastline, the beach is lined by luxurious five-star hotels, making it a prestigious beach location. Since the beach is close to many other well-known Goa beaches, you may get there by either renting a private car or just taking a rickshaw. When the water is low, you can go from Palolem and Patnem beaches to Rajbagh Beach if you wish to walk in the water. 8. Shri Shantadurga Temple One of the biggest temple complexes in Goa is called Shri Shantadurga Temple. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' patron deity, Goddess Durga, is honored in this work of art. Vishnu and Shiva are reconciled via the mediation of the goddess Shantadurga. During the Mahapanchami festival, the goddess is hauled around on a gilded palki (palanquin), which is the focal point of the temple. Three minor temples and one major temple with a pyramidal roof make up the Shanta Durga Temple. These temples are made of Kashmiri stone, including the floors and pillars. It was constructed around 1715 AD. Following the Portuguese's takeover of the state, it was moved from Keloshi to its present position. The stunning Indo-Portuguese architecture of the temple and the splendid idol of the divinity are a visual delight and make it a well-known tourist destination. The temple complex is perched atop a hill with a beautiful panorama of the surroundings. 9. Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals. It is held at the Church of St. John the Baptist, which was built in the 16th century and is made of unstained Italian marble. One of Goa's largest festivals, the Fama of Menino Jesus, which is observed on the third Monday in October, is held at the Nossa Senhora de Merces (Our Lady of Mercy) Church, a 17th-century marvel showcasing the classic aspects of Goan architecture.

Palolem Beach Palolem Beach, a white sand paradise in South Goa, is one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Goa. It is located around 38 miles from Madgaon in Cancona. Comparatively speaking to other of the more well-known beaches in Goa, Palolem Beach is renowned for its tranquility and tranquillity. The dolphin viewing cruise is Palolem Beach's main attraction. The spotless beach, beach shacks, and a few gift shops are some of Palolem's other key draws. Palolem Beach is nestled amid mountainous slopes on all sides and has serene surroundings. Walking around the beach will take you between 15 and 20 minutes. Palolem Beach is also well-known for its parties with soft music. Be careful as you circle the beach since Tibetan jewelry and beach town attire could hurt your wallet. Without a doubt, the praise is due to the Palolem market. The market here is considerably larger than those at other beaches and features Tibetan handicrafts, seashell decorations, and a great selection of stylish clothing. No matter the season, the market is active and draws lots of visitors. Additionally, the nearby clothing, spice, and music stores will undoubtedly make you feel like a hippie. To get to Canacona or Palolem, board a bus at the Margao Bus Stand. This trip typically takes 90 minutes and costs 40 rupees. The short 3-kilometer trip to Palolem Beach can be made after arriving at the Canacona bus terminal by taxi or autorickshaw. You can rent a bike or a moped to travel through the streets lined with palm trees for an exhilarating experience. 10. Benaulim Beach The tranquil Benaulim beach is located about 2 kilometers from South Goa's Colva, a popular tourist destination. This picturesque beach is the ideal location for a tranquil getaway far from the crowded beaches of North Goa, with its long stretch of vacant sands scattered with tempting beach chairs. It is well-known for its dolphin-spotting cruises and water sports activities. Since fishing is a popular activity at Benaulim Beach, there are several improvised beach shacks providing delectable seafood. Due to the low number of visitors who frequent this beach, it is always calm and serene. The party scene isn't as active all night long as the North Goa party beaches. On the other hand, energetic music is played in the numerous shacks and eateries on Benaulim beach. Between October and May, bullfights are frequently held in the huge rice fields. There are two churches near Benaulim Beach. They are: The Feast of St. John the Baptist, also known as San Joao, is a form of gratitude observed at the beginning of the monsoon season with great excitement by the locals.
