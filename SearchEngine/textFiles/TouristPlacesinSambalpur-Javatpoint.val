It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.

It has a population of 335,761 and is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. There are prehistoric settlements known to exist. The famous Sambalpuri Saree is produced here. The city is home to numerous parks, historic structures, and temples. Here is a list of a few tourist places in Sambalpur that you can visit. 1. Hirakud Dam The Hirakud Dam, built in Sambalpur, Odisha, across the Mahanadi River, is recognized as the country's longest man-made dam. Surprisingly, it is more than 56km long and is a favorite among both locals and visitors looking to spend a relaxing day outside. This magnificent piece of architecture was constructed in 1956, and because of its location, it is a great place to see nature come to life in all its splendor. One of the main draws of this area is a drive-through road that allows you to travel 21 kilometers above the dam while admiring its ingenuity and skill. Of course, the expansive perspective provided by the Gandhi and Nehru Minarets, which are situated toward the northern side of the dam, is another eye-catching aspect of the dam. Due to the abundance of trees and water surrounding it on all sides, it is also an excellent location for birdwatching. The Hirakud Dam's charming setting and wealth of luxuriant vegetation would appeal to any lover of nature. Between both the Burla and Hirakud Hills is where the dam is located. The dam produces hydroelectricity and irrigates 7,500,000 hectares of land in addition to presenting breathtaking natural beauty. Budharaja Hill, so named because of the Budharaja Temple at its summit, is a hill close to the Hirakud Dam. From this temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, you can see the dam in its magnificent entirety. Another important temple to see in Hirakud is the Ghanteshwari Temple, which acted as a warning beacon for approaching ships thanks to its bells. For a peaceful retreat in the midst of nature, travel to this location. This location has an extremely severe environment, with summertime highs of around 40 degrees Celsius and wintertime lows of just 1 degree Celsius. The monsoon season brings with it a lot of rain to the region. Since the weather is often favorable during this period, September to March is the best time to visit Sambalpur. Additionally, February, November, and December are great times to visit this town. 2. Gudguda Waterfall One of the most lovely picnic areas is Gudguda. Although Gudguda is located in the Sambalpur District, residents of Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, and even Rourkela frequently travel there. It takes 1.5 hours to get there from Jharsuguda. After you pass through Kolabira Village, the roads are excellent. The trip there is really enjoyable. After Kolabira Village, few vehicles are left. This area is completely covered with thick forest. Numerous mango and licorice orchards can be found on both sides of the roads as you approach the location. Birds chirping, a waterfall rushing, and other sounds are also audible. You'll adore this location because it's a serene get away from your frantic daily schedule. Let us inform you that a small waterfall must be crossed before reaching the precise location. If you have a four-wheel vehicle, this may be done with ease. Three step-by-step waterfalls can be found at this location, and they have skillfully cut their own paths through the surrounding rocks. Mountain hiking is another activity that is enjoyable here. If you intend to visit this location, don't forget to bring hiking boots. The water flowing in these falls is very cold, in part because it is shielded from the sun on all sides. Viewing the photos shot there will help you learn more about the location, rest assured. The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur. Jarsuguda is the name of the closest railroad station, and it is around 75 kilometers away. 3. Maa Ghanteswari Temple In Sambalpur, Maa Ghanteswari Temple is among the most revered and stunning locations. Bells (Ghanti), as the name suggests, are present everywhere. Following the realization of their wishes, people present Maa with bells. Every day, many pilgrims from all around the state come to this location. This is referred to as the Chipilima Heart (a beautiful picnic spot). The unique feature of this temple area?and the only one of its sort in Orissa?is the tens of thousands of bells that dangle everywhere. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated along the banks of the Mahanadi River, 33 kilometers southwest of Sambalpur. In the past, it had a significant impact on navigation. It was referred to be a lighthouse devoid of light. The goddess Ghanteswari gave the location its name. The navigators were made aware of this tremorous site and avoided it because there used to be some large bells in this location that were producing a loud sound with the help of the wind. Due to the convergence of three separate Mahanadi River streams, the water current in this place is extremely turbulent and forms a vortex. As a result, numerous vessels perished as they approached this location. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). The closest railroad station is called Hirakud, and it is around 20 kilometers away. Either Sambalpur City or Hirakud Station are good places to start your journey. To get to Goshala, take the Bargarh-Sambalpur Road. It would be best if you traveled down Chipilma Road in Goshala, which is located on the left side of the town. The Maa Ghanteswari Temple is situated here. 4. Huma Leaning Shiva Temple A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision, located 23 kilometers south of Sambalpur on the left side of the Mahanadi, has a Temple of Lord Siva. The sixth Raja of Sambalpur, Baliar Singh, had the Tilt Temple of Lord Siva constructed in the village. A milkman named Gauda is supposed to have started Siva worship by daily crossing the Mahanadi to a location on the bank in which the exposed rock could be seen. Daily milk offerings were made to the rock here, and when the rock drank them all, it sparked an investigation that resulted in the construction of the current temple. Huma is a pilgrimage destination that is also frequented by visitors who are curious about the various kinds of fish found in the river. Every year, in March, to celebrate Shivratri, a large fair is held at the foothill. Bimaleswar Siva is the ruling deity. Kudo fish are a unique species of fish that may be found in this area. They are claimed to be so docile that they will take food from the hands of those who take a bath adjacent to the temple, including sweets. They are addressed by their first names on auspicious days and given God's prasad. Here, nobody tries to trap them because it is thought that they are God's property. Now, let's talk about the temple's tilting structure, which is its main draw. Nobody was able to provide an adequate response during our team's inquiry and interviews. The major part of the temple was inclined in one direction, which was unexpected, while smaller temples were skewed in a different direction. And everything was discovered to be skewed within the bounds of the temple complex, i.e., within the walls of the temple. According to the villagers and monks, the angle of inclination hasn't changed in the past 40 or 50 years. However, the building's tilt may be caused by a geological factor; perhaps the structure of the earth's crust is uneven. It is impossible to determine whether the inclination is increasing or decreasing. In order to analyze it accurately, as is done in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, some form of measuring mechanism should be provided. Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km) and Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar are the closest airports (300 km). The industrial township of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Maneswar is the closest railway station, and it takes 25 kilometers to get to the temple from there. Either Sambalpur City or Maneswar Station are good places to start your journey. Afterward, travel down the Sonpur-Sambalpur Road to Huma Village. The Lord Shiva Leaning Temple can be seen here. Around 25 km separate Sambalpur from the Huma Temple. 5. Samaleswari Temple In Sambalpur, Western Odisha, India, there is a Hindu temple called Samaleswari Temple. It is devoted to the deity known as "Samaleswari," often referred to by the locals as "Mother Samaleswari" or "Samalei Maa." The protector god of Sambalpur, Shree Samaleswari, is a powerful religious figure in the western Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The mother goddess Samaleswari, also known as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, has been worshipped as the creator of the universe on the banks of the river Mahanadi from ancient times. She is the sole Goddess in Odisha, after Lord Jagannath, to preside over such a vast area, comprising all of Western Odisha and portions of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The area where the temple is located has a diverse cultural history. Her shrine, popularly known as the Samaleswari temple, is revered by the locals with great care and devotion. Three festivals stand out among the many others that are celebrated in front of the goddess throughout the year. The first two are Navaratri pujas, which are held in the months of March and April and September and October, respectively (Chaitra Navaratri and Ashwin Navaratri, respectively). The closest airports are Biju Pattnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar and Swami Vivekananda International Airport in Raipur (265 km away) (300 km). The industrial town of Jharsuguda (50 km) is getting a new airport built, and Jamadarpali is the closest airport (10 km). Only 2 km separate you from Sambalpur, which is the closest railway station. 7 km separates you from the private bus stop. One can find an auto or taxi.
