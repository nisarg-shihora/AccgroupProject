Jasprit Bumrah Bowling Style Initially, Bumrah got famous due to his typical bowling style. He still has the same bowling action. Bumrah makes a brief run-up, the first few steps of which are short, like the staccato strides. He generates high pace with an odd stiff-armed movement, and the batters have a hard time reading his bowling because of his peculiar point of release. He frequently bowls short or outside the off-stump. Bumrah is known as one of the fastest Indian bowlers, outperforming Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc with a high speed of 90 km/h during the first Test of the 2018 India Tour of Australia at the Adelaide Oval. "Wasim Akram, Brett Lee, and Mitchell Johnson are three of my all-time favourite bowlers. They had videos that I used to watch and learn from. Johnson and Malinga have taught me a lot, too. Any senior bowlers who have competed in international cricket are someone I aim to learn from", Bumrah said this in an interview earlier. Comments by people on his bowling style: Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of India, added these words on his bowling motion: "Nothing matters what you do throughout the first 75 to 80 percent of your run-up. The crucial portion is the last 15-20%, or the final four or five steps. Now you're bowling. Bumrah moves in a different way as he runs, but his last three to four strides show that he is loading, with his front and back legs in perfect alignment, and he moves quickly into the air." Jeff Thomson, a former Australian cricketer, added these words on his bowling action: "Jasprit Bumrah intrigues me a great deal, in my opinion. He takes off after a little run-up. He runs a short distance before bowling. His arms are straight. His bowling is by no means textbook perfect, yet it strikes a chord. He stands out among other pace bowlers in a way that makes me think of Jeff Thomson, another fast bowler from my generation who stood out from the crowd." Shane Bond, a former fast bowler for New Zealand and a bowling coach, said: "Boom's movement is original, but it can be imitated. He's quite well-controlled." Net Worth As of 2018, his retainer fee was Rs. 7 crore, including Rs. 15 lakhs for the Test matches, 6 lakh for ODIs, and Rs. 3 lakh for T20Is. Controversy In order to increase traffic awareness, the Jaipur Traffic Police displayed a hoarding showing Bumrah's no-ball to Pakistani batter Fakhar Zaman in the ICC Champions Trophy final in June 2017. Bumrah expressed his annoyance at the use of his photo as a meme on Twitter after discovering it. Next TopicMamta Kulkarni ? prev next ?

Any senior bowlers who have competed in international cricket are someone I aim to learn from", Bumrah said this in an interview earlier. Comments by people on his bowling style: Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of India, added these words on his bowling motion: "Nothing matters what you do throughout the first 75 to 80 percent of your run-up.

He runs a short distance before bowling. His arms are straight. His bowling is by no means textbook perfect, yet it strikes a chord. He stands out among other pace bowlers in a way that makes me think of Jeff Thomson, another fast bowler from my generation who stood out from the crowd."

"Wasim Akram, Brett Lee, and Mitchell Johnson are three of my all-time favourite bowlers. They had videos that I used to watch and learn from. Johnson and Malinga have taught me a lot, too. Any senior bowlers who have competed in international cricket are someone I aim to learn from", Bumrah said this in an interview earlier. Comments by people on his bowling style: Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of India, added these words on his bowling motion: "Nothing matters what you do throughout the first 75 to 80 percent of your run-up. The crucial portion is the last 15-20%, or the final four or five steps. Now you're bowling. Bumrah moves in a different way as he runs, but his last three to four strides show that he is loading, with his front and back legs in perfect alignment, and he moves quickly into the air." Jeff Thomson, a former Australian cricketer, added these words on his bowling action: "Jasprit Bumrah intrigues me a great deal, in my opinion. He takes off after a little run-up. He runs a short distance before bowling. His arms are straight. His bowling is by no means textbook perfect, yet it strikes a chord. He stands out among other pace bowlers in a way that makes me think of Jeff Thomson, another fast bowler from my generation who stood out from the crowd." Shane Bond, a former fast bowler for New Zealand and a bowling coach, said: "Boom's movement is original, but it can be imitated. He's quite well-controlled." Net Worth As of 2018, his retainer fee was Rs. 7 crore, including Rs. 15 lakhs for the Test matches, 6 lakh for ODIs, and Rs. 3 lakh for T20Is.

Jasprit Bumrah Bowling Style Initially, Bumrah got famous due to his typical bowling style. He still has the same bowling action. Bumrah makes a brief run-up, the first few steps of which are short, like the staccato strides. He generates high pace with an odd stiff-armed movement, and the batters have a hard time reading his bowling because of his peculiar point of release. He frequently bowls short or outside the off-stump. Bumrah is known as one of the fastest Indian bowlers, outperforming Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc with a high speed of 90 km/h during the first Test of the 2018 India Tour of Australia at the Adelaide Oval. "Wasim Akram, Brett Lee, and Mitchell Johnson are three of my all-time favourite bowlers. They had videos that I used to watch and learn from. Johnson and Malinga have taught me a lot, too. Any senior bowlers who have competed in international cricket are someone I aim to learn from", Bumrah said this in an interview earlier. Comments by people on his bowling style: Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of India, added these words on his bowling motion: "Nothing matters what you do throughout the first 75 to 80 percent of your run-up. The crucial portion is the last 15-20%, or the final four or five steps. Now you're bowling. Bumrah moves in a different way as he runs, but his last three to four strides show that he is loading, with his front and back legs in perfect alignment, and he moves quickly into the air." Jeff Thomson, a former Australian cricketer, added these words on his bowling action: "Jasprit Bumrah intrigues me a great deal, in my opinion. He takes off after a little run-up. He runs a short distance before bowling. His arms are straight. His bowling is by no means textbook perfect, yet it strikes a chord. He stands out among other pace bowlers in a way that makes me think of Jeff Thomson, another fast bowler from my generation who stood out from the crowd." Shane Bond, a former fast bowler for New Zealand and a bowling coach, said: "Boom's movement is original, but it can be imitated. He's quite well-controlled." Net Worth As of 2018, his retainer fee was Rs. 7 crore, including Rs. 15 lakhs for the Test matches, 6 lakh for ODIs, and Rs. 3 lakh for T20Is.

Jasprit Bumrah Bowling Style Initially, Bumrah got famous due to his typical bowling style. He still has the same bowling action. Bumrah makes a brief run-up, the first few steps of which are short, like the staccato strides.

He frequently bowls short or outside the off-stump.

"Wasim Akram, Brett Lee, and Mitchell Johnson are three of my all-time favourite bowlers. They had videos that I used to watch and learn from. Johnson and Malinga have taught me a lot, too. Any senior bowlers who have competed in international cricket are someone I aim to learn from", Bumrah said this in an interview earlier. Comments by people on his bowling style: Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of India, added these words on his bowling motion: "Nothing matters what you do throughout the first 75 to 80 percent of your run-up. The crucial portion is the last 15-20%, or the final four or five steps. Now you're bowling. Bumrah moves in a different way as he runs, but his last three to four strides show that he is loading, with his front and back legs in perfect alignment, and he moves quickly into the air." Jeff Thomson, a former Australian cricketer, added these words on his bowling action: "Jasprit Bumrah intrigues me a great deal, in my opinion. He takes off after a little run-up. He runs a short distance before bowling. His arms are straight. His bowling is by no means textbook perfect, yet it strikes a chord. He stands out among other pace bowlers in a way that makes me think of Jeff Thomson, another fast bowler from my generation who stood out from the crowd." Shane Bond, a former fast bowler for New Zealand and a bowling coach, said: "Boom's movement is original, but it can be imitated. He's quite well-controlled." Net Worth As of 2018, his retainer fee was Rs. 7 crore, including Rs. 15 lakhs for the Test matches, 6 lakh for ODIs, and Rs. 3 lakh for T20Is.

Jasprit Bumrah Bowling Style Initially, Bumrah got famous due to his typical bowling style. He still has the same bowling action. Bumrah makes a brief run-up, the first few steps of which are short, like the staccato strides. He generates high pace with an odd stiff-armed movement, and the batters have a hard time reading his bowling because of his peculiar point of release. He frequently bowls short or outside the off-stump. Bumrah is known as one of the fastest Indian bowlers, outperforming Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc with a high speed of 90 km/h during the first Test of the 2018 India Tour of Australia at the Adelaide Oval. "Wasim Akram, Brett Lee, and Mitchell Johnson are three of my all-time favourite bowlers. They had videos that I used to watch and learn from. Johnson and Malinga have taught me a lot, too. Any senior bowlers who have competed in international cricket are someone I aim to learn from", Bumrah said this in an interview earlier. Comments by people on his bowling style: Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of India, added these words on his bowling motion: "Nothing matters what you do throughout the first 75 to 80 percent of your run-up. The crucial portion is the last 15-20%, or the final four or five steps. Now you're bowling. Bumrah moves in a different way as he runs, but his last three to four strides show that he is loading, with his front and back legs in perfect alignment, and he moves quickly into the air." Jeff Thomson, a former Australian cricketer, added these words on his bowling action: "Jasprit Bumrah intrigues me a great deal, in my opinion. He takes off after a little run-up. He runs a short distance before bowling. His arms are straight. His bowling is by no means textbook perfect, yet it strikes a chord. He stands out among other pace bowlers in a way that makes me think of Jeff Thomson, another fast bowler from my generation who stood out from the crowd." Shane Bond, a former fast bowler for New Zealand and a bowling coach, said: "Boom's movement is original, but it can be imitated. He's quite well-controlled." Net Worth As of 2018, his retainer fee was Rs. 7 crore, including Rs. 15 lakhs for the Test matches, 6 lakh for ODIs, and Rs. 3 lakh for T20Is. Controversy In order to increase traffic awareness, the Jaipur Traffic Police displayed a hoarding showing Bumrah's no-ball to Pakistani batter Fakhar Zaman in the ICC Champions Trophy final in June 2017. Bumrah expressed his annoyance at the use of his photo as a meme on Twitter after discovering it. Next TopicMamta Kulkarni ? prev next ?
