She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise.

Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu.

In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office.

She is one of the few actresses who equally gained her name in the north and south film industries. Even though she initially started her career in the south, she then paved her path slowly in the north. She created her style with her unique curly hair looks and is an award-winning actress too. Pannu has grossed many films with her female-led characters. Her witty and sarcastic way of answering media questions has sometimes dragged her into controversies and sometimes brought her praise. Early Life: Taapsee Pannu was born in New Delhi on the 1st of August 1987. Her father, Dilmohan Singh Pannu, works in the real estate market, while her mother, Nirmaljeet, is a homemaker. She belongs of Punjabi origin. Pannu has a younger sibling, and her name is Shagun Pannu, and Taapsee Pannu's schooling has happened in Mata Jai Kaur Public School, Delhi. She did her bachelor's in computer science engineering. After her graduation, she also worked as a full-time software engineer. After working as a software engineer, she entered the modelling industry. She first auditioned for the 'Get gorgeous' talent show. Her profile got good exposure after the auditions. She has done many walks on modelling shows, including Femina Miss India. Meanwhile, she was doing TV commercials for bigger brands like Red FM, Motorola, Reliance Trends, Standard Chartered Bank, Airtel, PVR cinemas, Dabur and Havells. After quite an ample amount of time doing modelling, Pannu wanted to shift her career to acting. That's when she decided to audition for movies and started doing so. Her career in the south film industry: Taapsee's first Telugu film, 'Jhummandi Naadam,' was released in 2010, in which she acted with Manchu Manoj. She also got three film offers along with this film. But, Pannu signed to 'Jhummandi Naadam.' She then acted in 'Aadukalam,' her Tamil debut film starring Dhanush in 2011. The film won six awards in six different categories at the fifty-eighth National Film Awards. The same year, she did a film called 'Vastadu Naa Raju' in Telugu with Vishnu Manchu. Reportedly, the film did not do remarkable at the box office. She did a Malayali film called 'Doubles' the next year. She acted along with Mammootty, a renowned actor in the Malayalam film industry. In 2011, Taapsee acted as the second heroine in a Telugu film called 'Mr Perfect'. Prabhas and Kajal Aggarwal were her co-actors in the movie. Her next film happened to be 'Veera', in which Ravi Teja and Kajal Aggarwal were the main leads. Taapsee was the second female heroine in the film. It was a high-budget film, but it did not satisfy the audience and just survived at the box office. Pannu kept switching languages in the south industry according to her choice. After 'Veera,' a Tamil film called 'Vandhaan Vendraan' was her next. Unfortunately, this film also did not go well at the box office. After two consecutive second lead characters, she decided to play the main lead in the film. On that note, she then acted in the Telugu film 'Mogudu' directed by Krishna Vamsi. Later along with Lakshmi Manchu, she did the Telugu film called 'gundello Godari.' In 2012, she acted opposite Ravi Teja in the movie 'Daruvu.' Even though the movie belongs to the feel-good genre, it was not commercially successful. After that movie, 'shadow' is the movie she acted alongside Daggupati Venkatesh. Then in 2013, she acted in a Tamil film 'Arrambam' in which Nayanthara, Ajith Kumar and Arya were her co-stars. It was a big-budget action thriller which gave Taapsee prestigious awards for her film performance. Her next film was with Raghava Lawrence, who directed, produced, wrote and acted in his film' muni-3.' Then, in the Tamil film 'Vai Raja Vai,' she gave a guest appearance in the film. In 2019, she did a Telugu film, 'Anando Brahma.' It was an action-comedy film. Later she acted in 'Neevevaro,' with Aadhi and Ritika Singh. She again did a Tamil film in the south, 'Annabelle Sethupathi.' She acted opposite Vijay Sethupathi in the film. The film did 'not bad' at the box office. After 'Anando Brahma,' Taapsee wanted to prove herself again in Telugu and signed up for the film Mishan Impossible film. The film is yet to release. The media already said that the film would be released in April 2022. Her career in the north film industry: Taapsee Pannu's first Hindi debut film was 'Chashme Baddoor.' She acted along with Rishi Kapoor in her first Hindi debut film itself. Apart from the negative reviews she got for the film, the film was a commercial success at the box office. After her consecutive south movie releases, she had a long break of one year with no films. Later that year, Pannu starred in a supporting role character in the film 'Baby' in which Akshay Kumar was the main lead and in 2017, she acted in 'Running Shaadi' directed by Amit Roy. While Pannu was shooting for 'Running Shaadi,' she got the offer for the film 'Pink.' The film was starring Amitabh Bachan, so Taapsee got all prepped up for the film. The film was about three girls leading their lives, and their lives will take an ugly turn because of a sexual assault. Taapse's performance was praised immensely by many critics as well as audiences. Also, the film grossed nearly one billion at the box office and was recorded as a huge commercial success in her career. After her film 'Running Shaadi,' 'The Ghazi Attack' was her film. It starred Rana Daggubati. The film was about the underwater war between Indo-pak in 1971 and was released in Tamil and Telugu languages, but the film was average at the box office. Pannu then did a film called 'Naam Shabana.' Her role in the film required her to learn martial arts, so she learnt martial arts too to fit into the role. This time Pannu met the expectations of critics. Then she did a Telugu film, followed by the film 'Judwaa 2.' The movie was commercially a success grossing about two billion at the box office. In 2018, she was portrayed in the movie 'Dil Junglee'. The film did not satisfy the audience and critics at all. Taapsee Pannu's next film was 'Soorma', based on a hockey player. However, the film did not create good reviews from critics but was a hit at the box office. 'Mulk' was her next film, directed by Anubhav Sinha. The film was all about nationalism and patriotism. Next was Anurag Kashyap's Manmarziyaan film. She acted along with Vicky Kaushal and Abhishek Bachan. The movie was once premiered at International Film Festival in Toronto in 2018. Taapsee had two film releases in the same year:' Nitishastra' and 'Baarish Aur Chowmein.' In 2019, she acted in a Spanish remake 'Badla.' Acting in this film became Taapsee's second collaboration with Amitabh Bachan. Pannu was supposed to act as a second lead in the film, but she convinced the director for the main lead and did the film. She did great in the film and fulfilled critics. The film also did well at the box office. She has done a psychological thriller film, 'Game Over' by Ashwin Saravanan. It was released in Telugu and Tamil languages simultaneously. She is then portrayed as a space scientist in the film 'Mission mangal.' The film grossed 2.9 billion at the box office. Then 'Saand Ki Aankh' was her next film. Bhumi Pednekar was her co-actor. Pannu acted as a sharpshooter in the film. They both got enough recognition for the film. Her next film was 'Thappad.' By this time, Taapsee had gained a name that she could pull off the female lead character. On that go, she was given a character in the film. She was a regular housewife in the film, and the plot in the film is bought out when her husband slaps her. The film did great, and Taapsee was bombarded with positive reviews from the audience and critics, including articles about her performance in 'The Indian Express.' She was also awarded for the film. In 2021, she acted in 'Haseen Dillruba,' where Vikrant Massey and Harshvardhan Rane also starred. The film was an OTT release. It was recorded as the most-watched film on Netflix in 2021. 'Rashmi Rocket' was her next Hindi film. The film tells the story of an Indian athlete. She performed with all her efforts in the film. Next year, 'Loop Lepeta,' the remake of a German film, came up on OTT platforms. She signed with Anurag Kashyap for the film 'Dobaaraa.' Also, a film based on Mithila Raj's autobiography 'Shabaash Mithu' is yet to come. Awards: Taapsee Pannu's first award was for a Telugu film 'Gundello Godari.'
