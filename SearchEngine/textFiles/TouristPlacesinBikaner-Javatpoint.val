Before 1488 it was a barren land covered with sand located amidst the Thar desert. But even then, it was a popular point amongst travelers from Central Asia due to the presence of an oasis. Rao Bika was Maharaja Rao Jodha's son. Maharaja Rao Jodha belonged to the Rathore Clan and was the founder of Jodhpur city. His son didn't want to inherit what his father built and created his Kingdom, Bikaner. The city has been named after its founder, Rao Bika. When the Mughals came to rule over India, the city was under the control of Emperor Akbar and his son Jahangir. General Maharaja Ganga Singh ruled over the place during British rule in India. In 1949, the city acceded to the Union of India. From a barren place to the fourth largest city in India, Bikaner has progressed a lot. The Ganges Canal (1928) and Indira Gandhi Canal (1987) have aided in its development to a great extent.With sand dunes spread across the city, it boasts its forts, palaces, and rich cultural heritage.
