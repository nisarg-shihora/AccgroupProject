In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {
                        // print odd that is waiting
                        System.out.println("Odd waiting : " + counter);

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {
                        // print odd that is waiting
                        System.out.println("Odd waiting : " + counter);
                        // call wait() method
                        wait();

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads

    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {

 Output: By Using Remainder In this technique of printing even and odd numbers with two threads, the code is based on the following two points: If num%2==1, odd will print the number and increment it. Else odd will go in the wait state. If number52==0, even will print the number and increment it. Else even will go in the wait state. EvenOddRunnable.java

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {

We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {
                        // print odd that is waiting
                        System.out.println("Odd waiting : " + counter);
                        // call wait() method
                        wait();

                odd = false;

                notify();
            }
        }
    }
    // create printEvenNumbers() method to print even numbers
    public void printEvenNumbers() {
        // use try-catch block to sleep thread

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {
                        // print odd that is waiting
                        System.out.println("Odd waiting : " + counter);
                        // call wait() method
                        wait();

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {

In order to write a code for printing even and odd using 2 threads, it is required that we should have knowledge of multithreading. Now, we need to print the even and odd numbers in natural order up to MAX using two different threads. So, we have two ways to solve the problem, i.e., by using wait and notify and by using the concept of the remainder. By Using wait and notify In order to print the even and odd numbers using wait and notify, we use the following steps: We create a boolean variable odd whose value should be true when we need to print an odd number. We create two user-defined methods such as printEventNumbers() and printOddNumbers() to print even and odd numbers. We create two threads, i.e., thread1 and thread2, for even and odd numbers simultaneously. The thread1 will call printEvenNumbers() method and the thread2 will call printOddNumbers() method simultaneously. The thread1 will wait till the value of boolean odd is true in printEvenNumbers(). The thread2 will wait till the value of boolean odd is false in printOddNumbers(). Let's implement the code for printing the even odd numbers using wait and notify. PrintEvenOddExample1.java 
// import required classes and package if any
import java.util.Scanner;
// create class PrintEvenOddExample1 to print even and odd numbers using two threads
public class PrintEvenOddExample1 {
    // create a boolean variable odd for even and odd numbers
    boolean odd;
    int counter = 1;	// set initial counter to 1
    int MAX;
    // create printOddNumbers() method to print odd numbers
    public void printOddNumbers() {
        // synchronized block for odd numbers
        synchronized (this) {
            while (counter < MAX) {
                System.out.println("Syncronized block call for odd numbers.");
                while (!odd) {	// use wait and notify technique within while loop
                    // call wait() method within try-catch block for
                    try {
                        // print odd that is waiting
                        System.out.println("Odd waiting : " + counter);
                        // call wait() method
                        wait();
                        //print odd that is notified
                        System.out.println("Notified odd :" + counter);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {

                // print odd thread
                System.out.println("Odd Thread :" + counter);
                // increment counter variable
                counter++;
                // set boolean odd to false
                odd = false;
                // call notify()
                notify();
            }
        }
    }
    // create printEvenNumbers() method to print even numbers
