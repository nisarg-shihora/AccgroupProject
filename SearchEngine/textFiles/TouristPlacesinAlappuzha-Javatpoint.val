The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it.

The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it.

The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region. Due to the breathtaking scenery, this is among the most popular tourist destinations in the Alappuzha district.

Karumadikkuttan One of the best places to go in Alappuzha to seek the divine blessings of Buddha is a well-known pilgrim centre known for its tranquil atmosphere. Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7. Krishnapuram Palace The Krishnapuram Palace is a one-of-a-kind example of the architecture characteristic of the state of Kerala.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region.

Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7.

It is often referred to as the "Venice of the East" or the "Venetian Capital of Kerala" due to the picturesque landscape, water channels, beach resorts, and coastal waters that can be found there. Alleppey is also well-known for its backwaters, which attract many tourists thanks to the beautiful houseboats that operate there regularly. These houseboats, of which there are hundreds, give tourists access to several facilities in addition to a ride that is both enjoyable and relaxing. Even though houseboats are the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Alappuzha, there are quite a few fascinating places to explore in Alleppey. After February, the temperature in this coastal region becomes unbearable for tourism, so the ideal time to go to Alappuzha is between November and March. Let's take a deep dive into the well-known tourist spots in Alappuzha and list all the places in this beautiful city in Kerala that you absolutely cannot miss. 1.

This place of worship is devoted to the Hindu deity Sree Bhadrakali, who is worshipped here in a number of her forms. The fascinating aspect of the temple is that a sizeable portion of the offerings presented to the deity is put toward preparing the prasad that is served at Sabarimala. This dish is called "Appams" and "Aravana Payasam." It is among the most well-known and frequently visited temples in all of Alappuzha, which is located in the state of Kerala. It is common practice to respect the deity in each shape and form, such as Maha Saraswathi in the morning, Maha Lakshmi at noon, and Sri Durga in the evening-during the day in this temple. 2.

Kuttanad Backwaters The real charm of Alappuzha may be found in its many bodies of water, but the backwaters of Kuttanad are the ones that have gained the greatest reputation throughout the years. The Kuttanad backwaters, commonly known as the "Rice bowl of Kerala," are considered one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the Alappuzha region. Due to the breathtaking scenery, this is among the most popular tourist destinations in the Alappuzha district. It is among the rare places to visit in India where agriculture is done 10 ft below sea level, making it the lowest altitude in the country. Therefore, the Backwaters of Kuttanad are among the must-visit tourist spots in Alappuzha. One of the most popular things in Alappuzha is to take a boat ride through the Kuttanad backwaters while taking in the breathtaking scenery of the waters surrounded by coconut palms. The houseboats are the superior option because they provide comfortable and pleasant facilities, allowing you to take full advantage of this location and have a more satisfying experience overall. Rice barges or houseboats are recommended to get the most out of your time on this body of water. 6. Karumadikkuttan One of the best places to go in Alappuzha to seek the divine blessings of Buddha is a well-known pilgrim centre known for its tranquil atmosphere. Karumadikkuttan is the name of a marble statue of Lord Buddha that can be found in Karumadi, which is not far from Alappuzha. The locals have given it this name because the statue here is dark in colour. The statue is notable for several reasons. One is that it is missing the left side entirely because it contains such a stunning example of Buddhist architecture; Alappuzha is a popular destination for people seeking spiritual fulfilment through vacationing. The statue was discovered and retrieved by the Archeological Association of India, and it is now housed in a secure enclosure close to the Karumadi Canal. The people who live in and around Karumadi have a strong desire to seek blessings from the statue because they believe it possesses the ability to provide severe healing to those who look upon it. Despite this, it is still going to be kept safe because of the withered state it is currently in. 7. Krishnapuram Palace The Krishnapuram Palace is a one-of-a-kind example of the architecture characteristic of the state of Kerala. Its gabled, low roofs and winding corridors make it a fascinating sight. Due to its proximity to the Krishnaswamy Temple and its construction in the traditional style of Kerala, the palace is widely considered the state's most popular tourist destination. This palace's accurate construction date could not be determined, but the Archeology Department notes that it is now considered a protected monument because of its historical significance. This palace serves as an archaeological museum. Its most noteworthy exhibit is a mural painting that spans 49 square meters and is titled Gajendra Moksham, which translates to "the salvation of the elephant king." In addition to these works of art, a lushly landscaped garden within the palace's compound should also be visited. 8. Marari Beach Marari Beach is among the best places to visit in Alappuzha for vacations with friends and family because it is beautiful and features golden sands and coconut palm trees.
