Gangaikonda Cholapuram You will be enchanted and amazed by the beauty of the Brihadishwara temple and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram due to their engineering and antiquity. Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a location that is a tribute to the region's engineering and architectural brilliance and the pride of one of India's finest empires?the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola's rule in 1025 CE, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was designated as the Cholas' capital, and it remained there for about 250 years. The famed Brihadeeswarar Temple is located in this medieval town. Rajendra Chola I, Rajaraja Chola's son and successor, constructed it. The "Great Living Chola Temples" UNESCO World Heritage Site includes this temple. Rajendra Chola built this temple following his impressive triumphs in Northern India. After being crowned, he changed his name from Madurantakam to Rajendra, but for a while, he shared the throne with his father, Rajaraja-I. The Brihadisvara Temple in GangaiKondaCholapuram is thought to be a replica of the original, which was constructed by Rajaraja Chola, Rajendra Chola's father. The largest Shiva Lingam in the Southern region of India is said to be located in this temple. For more than two centuries, Gangaikonda Cholapuram served as the capital of the Chola Empire. This location of tremendous historical significance highlighted the start of one of the greatest reigns in Southern Indian history. The once-famous historical city is now only a little village, with the Lord Siva temple serving as a reminder of its once-proud past splendor. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which is sometimes compared to Thanjavur, another outstanding Chola city, is a wonderful destination to discover and uncover its heritage, magnificence, and elaborate marvels and tales, carefully buried deep in history. 2. Brihadeeswarar Temple Brihadeeswarar Temple is regarded as the most elaborate example of South Indian temple architecture.

A huge mandapa is followed by an antarala and the sanctuary in the main temple of Brihadeeswarar, which has an incredible architecture.

Gangaikonda Cholapuram You will be enchanted and amazed by the beauty of the Brihadishwara temple and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram due to their engineering and antiquity. Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a location that is a tribute to the region's engineering and architectural brilliance and the pride of one of India's finest empires?the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola's rule in 1025 CE, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was designated as the Cholas' capital, and it remained there for about 250 years. The famed Brihadeeswarar Temple is located in this medieval town. Rajendra Chola I, Rajaraja Chola's son and successor, constructed it. The "Great Living Chola Temples" UNESCO World Heritage Site includes this temple. Rajendra Chola built this temple following his impressive triumphs in Northern India. After being crowned, he changed his name from Madurantakam to Rajendra, but for a while, he shared the throne with his father, Rajaraja-I.

The largest Shiva Lingam in the Southern region of India is said to be located in this temple. For more than two centuries, Gangaikonda Cholapuram served as the capital of the Chola Empire. This location of tremendous historical significance highlighted the start of one of the greatest reigns in Southern Indian history. The once-famous historical city is now only a little village, with the Lord Siva temple serving as a reminder of its once-proud past splendor. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which is sometimes compared to Thanjavur, another outstanding Chola city, is a wonderful destination to discover and uncover its heritage, magnificence, and elaborate marvels and tales, carefully buried deep in history. 2.

Gangaikonda Cholapuram You will be enchanted and amazed by the beauty of the Brihadishwara temple and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram due to their engineering and antiquity. Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a location that is a tribute to the region's engineering and architectural brilliance and the pride of one of India's finest empires?the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola's rule in 1025 CE, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was designated as the Cholas' capital, and it remained there for about 250 years. The famed Brihadeeswarar Temple is located in this medieval town. Rajendra Chola I, Rajaraja Chola's son and successor, constructed it. The "Great Living Chola Temples" UNESCO World Heritage Site includes this temple. Rajendra Chola built this temple following his impressive triumphs in Northern India. After being crowned, he changed his name from Madurantakam to Rajendra, but for a while, he shared the throne with his father, Rajaraja-I. The Brihadisvara Temple in GangaiKondaCholapuram is thought to be a replica of the original, which was constructed by Rajaraja Chola, Rajendra Chola's father. The largest Shiva Lingam in the Southern region of India is said to be located in this temple. For more than two centuries, Gangaikonda Cholapuram served as the capital of the Chola Empire. This location of tremendous historical significance highlighted the start of one of the greatest reigns in Southern Indian history. The once-famous historical city is now only a little village, with the Lord Siva temple serving as a reminder of its once-proud past splendor. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which is sometimes compared to Thanjavur, another outstanding Chola city, is a wonderful destination to discover and uncover its heritage, magnificence, and elaborate marvels and tales, carefully buried deep in history. 2. Brihadeeswarar Temple Brihadeeswarar Temple is regarded as the most elaborate example of South Indian temple architecture. Raja Raja Chola I constructed the Brihadeeswara temple, one of the city's most significant attractions. It was allegedly built as a celebration of the Chola Kingdom's victory and is now a world heritage site. It is also referred to as Periya Kovil or Peruvudaiyar Kovil. The temple is a component of the "Great Living Chola Temples'' UNESCO World Heritage Site. Brihadeeswarar Temple also referred to as The Big Temple, is a temple devoted to Lord Shiva that is renowned for its size and exquisite artwork. The temple is made up of an entry tower and the main temple complex that is spread out across a 33,000-square-foot square foot plot of land. A 12-foot-tall monolithic idol with an artistically carved Nandi Mandapa marks the beginning of the temple's interior. A huge mandapa is followed by an antarala and the sanctuary in the main temple of Brihadeeswarar, which has an incredible architecture. The main draw of the 216-foot-tall, Dravidian-styled tower with 13 levels that overlook the sanctum is the temple. The vimana is proud of its enormous, 80-ton weight. According to legend, a 2 km long ramp was constructed to transport and position the Sikhara on the mountain. Sikhara never casts a shadow that hits the floor. The vimana from the temple is much larger than the temple tower at the entrance, which is unusual for Hindu temples. Exquisite mural paintings once graced the interior walls of the maha mandapa of the temple, but they disintegrated over time owing to neglect. Some of these murals can be found in the museum, which is located in the temple's southern hallway. The walls of the circumambulatory passage's Chola murals had some badly affected sections.

The once-famous historical city is now only a little village, with the Lord Siva temple serving as a reminder of its once-proud past splendor. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which is sometimes compared to Thanjavur, another outstanding Chola city, is a wonderful destination to discover and uncover its heritage, magnificence, and elaborate marvels and tales, carefully buried deep in history. 2. Brihadeeswarar Temple Brihadeeswarar Temple is regarded as the most elaborate example of South Indian temple architecture. Raja Raja Chola I constructed the Brihadeeswara temple, one of the city's most significant attractions.

A 12-foot-tall monolithic idol with an artistically carved Nandi Mandapa marks the beginning of the temple's interior. A huge mandapa is followed by an antarala and the sanctuary in the main temple of Brihadeeswarar, which has an incredible architecture.

According to legend, a 2 km long ramp was constructed to transport and position the Sikhara on the mountain. Sikhara never casts a shadow that hits the floor.

Overall this old city can make you fall in love with the beauty and culture, and giving some time from your really busy schedule to spend time here is worth it. 1. Gangaikonda Cholapuram You will be enchanted and amazed by the beauty of the Brihadishwara temple and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram due to their engineering and antiquity. Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a location that is a tribute to the region's engineering and architectural brilliance and the pride of one of India's finest empires?the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola's rule in 1025 CE, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was designated as the Cholas' capital, and it remained there for about 250 years. The famed Brihadeeswarar Temple is located in this medieval town. Rajendra Chola I, Rajaraja Chola's son and successor, constructed it. The "Great Living Chola Temples" UNESCO World Heritage Site includes this temple. Rajendra Chola built this temple following his impressive triumphs in Northern India. After being crowned, he changed his name from Madurantakam to Rajendra, but for a while, he shared the throne with his father, Rajaraja-I. The Brihadisvara Temple in GangaiKondaCholapuram is thought to be a replica of the original, which was constructed by Rajaraja Chola, Rajendra Chola's father. The largest Shiva Lingam in the Southern region of India is said to be located in this temple. For more than two centuries, Gangaikonda Cholapuram served as the capital of the Chola Empire. This location of tremendous historical significance highlighted the start of one of the greatest reigns in Southern Indian history. The once-famous historical city is now only a little village, with the Lord Siva temple serving as a reminder of its once-proud past splendor. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which is sometimes compared to Thanjavur, another outstanding Chola city, is a wonderful destination to discover and uncover its heritage, magnificence, and elaborate marvels and tales, carefully buried deep in history. 2. Brihadeeswarar Temple Brihadeeswarar Temple is regarded as the most elaborate example of South Indian temple architecture. Raja Raja Chola I constructed the Brihadeeswara temple, one of the city's most significant attractions.

A huge mandapa is followed by an antarala and the sanctuary in the main temple of Brihadeeswarar, which has an incredible architecture. The main draw of the 216-foot-tall, Dravidian-styled tower with 13 levels that overlook the sanctum is the temple. The vimana is proud of its enormous, 80-ton weight. According to legend, a 2 km long ramp was constructed to transport and position the Sikhara on the mountain. Sikhara never casts a shadow that hits the floor. The vimana from the temple is much larger than the temple tower at the entrance, which is unusual for Hindu temples. Exquisite mural paintings once graced the interior walls of the maha mandapa of the temple, but they disintegrated over time owing to neglect. Some of these murals can be found in the museum, which is located in the temple's southern hallway. The walls of the circumambulatory passage's Chola murals had some badly affected sections.

Gangaikonda Cholapuram You will be enchanted and amazed by the beauty of the Brihadishwara temple and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram due to their engineering and antiquity. Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a location that is a tribute to the region's engineering and architectural brilliance and the pride of one of India's finest empires?the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola's rule in 1025 CE, Gangaikonda Cholapuram was designated as the Cholas' capital, and it remained there for about 250 years. The famed Brihadeeswarar Temple is located in this medieval town. Rajendra Chola I, Rajaraja Chola's son and successor, constructed it. The "Great Living Chola Temples" UNESCO World Heritage Site includes this temple. Rajendra Chola built this temple following his impressive triumphs in Northern India. After being crowned, he changed his name from Madurantakam to Rajendra, but for a while, he shared the throne with his father, Rajaraja-I.

The largest Shiva Lingam in the Southern region of India is said to be located in this temple. For more than two centuries, Gangaikonda Cholapuram served as the capital of the Chola Empire. This location of tremendous historical significance highlighted the start of one of the greatest reigns in Southern Indian history. The once-famous historical city is now only a little village, with the Lord Siva temple serving as a reminder of its once-proud past splendor. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which is sometimes compared to Thanjavur, another outstanding Chola city, is a wonderful destination to discover and uncover its heritage, magnificence, and elaborate marvels and tales, carefully buried deep in history. 2.
