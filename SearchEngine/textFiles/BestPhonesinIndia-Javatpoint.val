Apple iPhone SE (2022) How about having a phone with the same levels of performance as the flagship iPhones but for a much better price? Sounds like a tempting deal, doesn't it? Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other. Just as other iPhones, this one also seems to have low specs at first but beats everything that seems better by those numbers - something you find with all iPhones. It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The camera is rather simple, with only one on each side - 12MP on the rear (f/1.8) and 7MP on the front (f/2.2). It has a 2018 mAh battery with a charging speed of 20W. The battery seems to be low at first but is well more than enough for the screen size. Next TopicBest Cars in the World ? prev next ?

And it clearly shows in its technical specifications. It has a 6.1-inch XDR OLED display which is one of the best-in-class displays. It also has 4GB of RAM with three storage options 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB.

Apple iPhone SE (2022) How about having a phone with the same levels of performance as the flagship iPhones but for a much better price? Sounds like a tempting deal, doesn't it? Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other. Just as other iPhones, this one also seems to have low specs at first but beats everything that seems better by those numbers - something you find with all iPhones. It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The camera is rather simple, with only one on each side - 12MP on the rear (f/1.8) and 7MP on the front (f/2.2). It has a 2018 mAh battery with a charging speed of 20W. The battery seems to be low at first but is well more than enough for the screen size. Next TopicBest Cars in the World ? prev next ?

Here are some of the best phones you can get today in India. India's smartphone market is very competitive, which is why most of the top brands and models released worldwide are accessible in the country. The following list of smartphones is guaranteed to be an investment worth every penny and will provide a life longer than an average phone.

Apple iPhone SE (2022) How about having a phone with the same levels of performance as the flagship iPhones but for a much better price? Sounds like a tempting deal, doesn't it? Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other. Just as other iPhones, this one also seems to have low specs at first but beats everything that seems better by those numbers - something you find with all iPhones. It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The camera is rather simple, with only one on each side - 12MP on the rear (f/1.8) and 7MP on the front (f/2.2). It has a 2018 mAh battery with a charging speed of 20W. The battery seems to be low at first but is well more than enough for the screen size. Next TopicBest Cars in the World ? prev next ?

Apple iPhone SE (2022) How about having a phone with the same levels of performance as the flagship iPhones but for a much better price? Sounds like a tempting deal, doesn't it? Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other. Just as other iPhones, this one also seems to have low specs at first but beats everything that seems better by those numbers - something you find with all iPhones. It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The camera is rather simple, with only one on each side - 12MP on the rear (f/1.8) and 7MP on the front (f/2.2). It has a 2018 mAh battery with a charging speed of 20W. The battery seems to be low at first but is well more than enough for the screen size. Next TopicBest Cars in the World ? prev next ?

Apple iPhone SE (2022) How about having a phone with the same levels of performance as the flagship iPhones but for a much better price? Sounds like a tempting deal, doesn't it? Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other. Just as other iPhones, this one also seems to have low specs at first but beats everything that seems better by those numbers - something you find with all iPhones. It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB.

Apple iPhone SE (2022) How about having a phone with the same levels of performance as the flagship iPhones but for a much better price? Sounds like a tempting deal, doesn't it? Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other. Just as other iPhones, this one also seems to have low specs at first but beats everything that seems better by those numbers - something you find with all iPhones. It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The camera is rather simple, with only one on each side - 12MP on the rear (f/1.8) and 7MP on the front (f/2.2). It has a 2018 mAh battery with a charging speed of 20W. The battery seems to be low at first but is well more than enough for the screen size. Next TopicBest Cars in the World ? prev next ?

Here is the 2022 version of Apple's more affordable iPhone SE. The 4.7-inch display might throw you off, but don't count this small package out because it packs a punch. It is powered by the best mobile processor - the A15 Bionic. The smaller screen gives this beast of a processor much fewer pixels to handle, and as a result, you get a performance like no other.

It comes with RAM of 4GB along with three options for storage sizes which are 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB.

It is much more than just a tool for entertainment. Nowadays, so many professional communications, essential work applications, and access to information are all extremely important. A smartphone provides all these and a lot more to make your life - both personal and professional more convenient. However, a lot of users face the same issue where they have to replace their phones after barely passing two years. Many people would instead get something that provides good value in terms of the latest tech specs while having a longer life to prevent the hassle of going through hundreds of latest releases every once in a while, scouting for a new device. Here are some of the best phones you can get today in India. India's smartphone market is very competitive, which is why most of the top brands and models released worldwide are accessible in the country. The following list of smartphones is guaranteed to be an investment worth every penny and will provide a life longer than an average phone. Without further ado, let's see the list of Best Phones in India. 1. Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Unbeatable monarch of smartphones and the most potent one money can buy. It will never let you down since it is powered by Apple's renowned A15 Bionic processor, a powerhouse. It is proven that this phone is going to last you upwards of 5-7 years. Hence you can rest assured that your investment will be worthwhile, and you will not need an upgrade for a while. The storage options are 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, depending on the model you select, and it includes 6GB of RAM. The phone consists of a triple camera setup on the rear and a single camera on the front. On the back, it has 12MP with f/1.5 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide lens with f/1.8 aperture, and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. On the front, it has a 12MP with an f/2.2 aperture. The display is a 6.7-inch OLED panel that can go up to 120 Hz of refresh rate and delivers a smooth experience. The battery in the phone is 4352 mAh. This battery can be charged via normal wired charging at 27 W or even wirelessly with the help of MagSafe and Qi wireless charging, which go up to 15W and 7.5 W, respectively. 2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra This is currently SAMSUNG's absolute best, and it is certainly not hard to see why considering not only the design of the model but also the technical specifications and features of this phone. It delivers top-of-the-notch performance with the ever-so-reliable Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. It gives you two RAM size options - 8GB and 12GB as well as four storage options - 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. As for the camera, this phone gives a single camera of 40 MP (f/2.2) on the front, and on the back, it offers a quad-camera setup, which includes - 108MP primary lens (f/2.2), 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), 10MP telephoto lens (f/2.4), and a secondary telephoto lens which offers a greater zoom with an aperture of f/2.4. Both the battery and the charging of the phone are solid, with 5000 mAh life and 45W wired charging. The screen consists of a 6.8-inch OLED panel with a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The display of this phone is known to be the pinnacle among all smartphones, which includes even the iPhone ranking above it. 3. ASUS ROG Phone 6 Pro ASUS ROG is a gaming phone series from ASUS, which offers exclusive features for gaming performance. These features include a big 6000 mAh battery, 65 W fast charging, the strongest android processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, temperature control with GameCool 6 cooling system, a stunning gamer design, a big 6.7 inch AMOLED @ 165 Hz display panel, fast and high capacity 18GB RAM, and storage space of 512GB.

The rear camera setup consists of a 50MP wide lens (f/1.9), a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 5MP macro lens, while the front camera is a 12MP wide lens. The phone absolutely delivers to its expectations as a gaming device, but when considered for a non-gaming user, it falls a little behind, simply because firstly, the camera quality, while excellent, isn't as good as what others offer, and secondly, the design of the phone can be unnecessarily flashy as opposed to the sleek and premium feel of the looks provided by others. 4. OnePlus 10 Pro OnePlus is a renowned brand among android smartphones. The brand is well-known for providing excellent phones and a custom UI which provides features, the operating system android by itself does not while providing an interface just as friendly and similar in looks to android in order to give users easy navigation.

It has a solid battery of 5000 mAh along with an even more solid charging of 65W.

Like many other devices of the flagship range, it also offers one camera on the front - 32MP (f/2.2) and triple cameras on the rear - 48MP (f/1.8), 50MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and an 8MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). 5. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a smartphone whose screen is foldable, as you might've guessed by its name. Don't skip this yet, just because you think it's a foldable phone. It has something special for you - the screen has no trace of being foldable at any point! Normally, you would see a pivotal area in the middle but not in this phone. The display is absolutely seamless. This allows it to have a bigger display than most others while still maintaining the same size. As for technical specifications, the phone runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and offers 12GB of RAM with two storage options - 256GB and 512GB. It has a triple camera setup on the rear, just like most of its competitors, which comprises a 12MP wide lens (f/1.8), a 12MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2), and a 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.4). The front has something you don't see in flagships every day - a dual camera setup that consists of a 10MP lens (f/2.2) and a 4MP lens (f/1.8). It has a battery of 4400 mAh and supports average fast charging with a 25W charger. Charging is certainly not the best, but it gets the job done in a fair amount of time. And lastly, the display which is the main focus of this phone - 120 Hz 7.6-inch Infinity "Flex display" as termed by Samsung for their foldable display. 6. Vivo X80 Pro Plus If you are someone keeping out for the news in the Indian Phone market, you must have heard the brand's name before.
