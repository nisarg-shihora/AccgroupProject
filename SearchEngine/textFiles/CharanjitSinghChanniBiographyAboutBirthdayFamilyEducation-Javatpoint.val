After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.

After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016). Chief Minister of Punjab As the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge. He announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications.
