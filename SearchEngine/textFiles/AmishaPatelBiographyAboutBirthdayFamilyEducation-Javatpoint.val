She has a cute, innocent face and good acting skills. The blockbuster movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai" was Amisha's debut movie opposite Hrithik Roshan in 2000. She did numerous Hindi and other regional language movies and won two Filmfare for her first two movies. Amisha came to Bollywood as a cute actress and built her image as one of the sexiest actresses in Bollywood. She accepted challenging roles and transformed herself per the position's requirements, showing her hard work and persistence to remain in the industry. Personal Life Amisha was born on 9 June 1975 in a Gujarati family in Mumbai. Her father, Amit Patel, is a businessman, and her mother, Asha Patel, is a housewife. Amisha got her name from the confluence of her parents' names, Am from Amit and Sha from Asha, making Amisha. Amisha was born and brought up in Mumbai. Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a recognized lawyer and politician. In particular, he was the president of the Congress Pradesh Committee, Mumbai. Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films.

The first project under her production is Desi Magic, which is still unreleased due to some legal issues. Struggle Phase The phase during 2003 to 2006 was very hard for Amisha. Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further. After 2007, her career graph was going ups and downs. She did just a handful of films, like only one in 2018 and a few in 2011, 2013, and 2016. In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001. In 2004, she did her second world tour, Craze, with Hrithik, Lara Dutta, and Saif Ali Khan. She was also part of Kuch Dil Se…, a Bollywood star show.

Social Work Amisha always tried to help the society that gave her all the fame throughout her acting. In 2005, she did a stage performance to raise money for the victims hit by Tsunami Earthquake in 2004, along with other Indian stars. In the same year, she also performed at Temptations 2005, a charity event organized by the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP) in New Delhi.

In 2006, she joined PlanetRead, an NGO that helps villagers to read through songs. In 2007, she decided to raise awareness about human trafficking in the country. For that, she joined United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Relationships Initially, Amisha has been in a relationship with the director Vikram Bhatt since 2002. They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008. This relationship also continued for less than two years, and she spoke about her breakup in an interview in 2010 as the reason to focus on her career. Now, she is unmarried and possibly single. Controversies In 2006, a police complaint was filed against her by an employee of Air India for misbehaviour by her. He complained that she was angry for not upgrading the seat of her companion to first class on Mumbai- New York flight. When she returned from the USA, she claimed that all the allegations were false. Later, the matter was resolved by the event organizers, for which she went to the USA.

Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a recognized lawyer and politician. In particular, he was the president of the Congress Pradesh Committee, Mumbai. Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role.

Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful.

Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further.

The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001.

They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008. This relationship also continued for less than two years, and she spoke about her breakup in an interview in 2010 as the reason to focus on her career. Now, she is unmarried and possibly single. Controversies In 2006, a police complaint was filed against her by an employee of Air India for misbehaviour by her.

Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further. After 2007, her career graph was going ups and downs. She did just a handful of films, like only one in 2018 and a few in 2011, 2013, and 2016. In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001. In 2004, she did her second world tour, Craze, with Hrithik, Lara Dutta, and Saif Ali Khan. She was also part of Kuch Dil Se…, a Bollywood star show.

They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008.

She has a cute, innocent face and good acting skills. The blockbuster movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai" was Amisha's debut movie opposite Hrithik Roshan in 2000. She did numerous Hindi and other regional language movies and won two Filmfare for her first two movies. Amisha came to Bollywood as a cute actress and built her image as one of the sexiest actresses in Bollywood. She accepted challenging roles and transformed herself per the position's requirements, showing her hard work and persistence to remain in the industry. Personal Life Amisha was born on 9 June 1975 in a Gujarati family in Mumbai. Her father, Amit Patel, is a businessman, and her mother, Asha Patel, is a housewife. Amisha got her name from the confluence of her parents' names, Am from Amit and Sha from Asha, making Amisha. Amisha was born and brought up in Mumbai. Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a recognized lawyer and politician. In particular, he was the president of the Congress Pradesh Committee, Mumbai. Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films.

The first project under her production is Desi Magic, which is still unreleased due to some legal issues. Struggle Phase The phase during 2003 to 2006 was very hard for Amisha. Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further.

Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage.

She has a cute, innocent face and good acting skills. The blockbuster movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai" was Amisha's debut movie opposite Hrithik Roshan in 2000. She did numerous Hindi and other regional language movies and won two Filmfare for her first two movies. Amisha came to Bollywood as a cute actress and built her image as one of the sexiest actresses in Bollywood. She accepted challenging roles and transformed herself per the position's requirements, showing her hard work and persistence to remain in the industry. Personal Life Amisha was born on 9 June 1975 in a Gujarati family in Mumbai. Her father, Amit Patel, is a businessman, and her mother, Asha Patel, is a housewife. Amisha got her name from the confluence of her parents' names, Am from Amit and Sha from Asha, making Amisha. Amisha was born and brought up in Mumbai. Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a recognized lawyer and politician. In particular, he was the president of the Congress Pradesh Committee, Mumbai. Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films. Some notable movies of Amisha are listed in below table: Year Movie 2002 Aap Mujhe Acche Lagne Lage 2002 Kranti 2002 Yeh Hai Jalwa 2002 Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai 2003 Humraz 2003 Pudhiya Geethai (Tamil) 2004 Parwana 2004 Suno Sasurjee 2005 Naani (Telugu) 2005 Vaada 2005 Elaan 2005 Mangal Pandey: The Rising 2005 Zameer: The Fire Within 2005 Narasimhudu (Telugu) 2006 Mere Jeevan Sathi 2006 Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai 2006 Teesri Aankh: The Hidden Camera 2006 Tathastu 2006 Aankhen 2006 Aap Ki Khatir 2007 Honeymoon Travels Pvt.

The first project under her production is Desi Magic, which is still unreleased due to some legal issues. Struggle Phase The phase during 2003 to 2006 was very hard for Amisha. Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further. After 2007, her career graph was going ups and downs. She did just a handful of films, like only one in 2018 and a few in 2011, 2013, and 2016. In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001. In 2004, she did her second world tour, Craze, with Hrithik, Lara Dutta, and Saif Ali Khan. She was also part of Kuch Dil Se…, a Bollywood star show.

In the same year, she also performed at the promotional event of Akshay Kumar's movie Chandani Chowk to China, on Christmas with Akshay, Bipasa Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Riya Sen, Himesh Reshammiya, and Bohemia. Social Work Amisha always tried to help the society that gave her all the fame throughout her acting. In 2005, she did a stage performance to raise money for the victims hit by Tsunami Earthquake in 2004, along with other Indian stars. In the same year, she also performed at Temptations 2005, a charity event organized by the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP) in New Delhi.

In 2006, she joined PlanetRead, an NGO that helps villagers to read through songs. In 2007, she decided to raise awareness about human trafficking in the country. For that, she joined United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Relationships Initially, Amisha has been in a relationship with the director Vikram Bhatt since 2002. They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008. This relationship also continued for less than two years, and she spoke about her breakup in an interview in 2010 as the reason to focus on her career. Now, she is unmarried and possibly single. Controversies In 2006, a police complaint was filed against her by an employee of Air India for misbehaviour by her. He complained that she was angry for not upgrading the seat of her companion to first class on Mumbai- New York flight. When she returned from the USA, she claimed that all the allegations were false. Later, the matter was resolved by the event organizers, for which she went to the USA.

Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films.

The first project under her production is Desi Magic, which is still unreleased due to some legal issues. Struggle Phase The phase during 2003 to 2006 was very hard for Amisha. Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful.

Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further.

In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001.

In 2005, she did a stage performance to raise money for the victims hit by Tsunami Earthquake in 2004, along with other Indian stars. In the same year, she also performed at Temptations 2005, a charity event organized by the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP) in New Delhi.

In 2006, she joined PlanetRead, an NGO that helps villagers to read through songs. In 2007, she decided to raise awareness about human trafficking in the country. For that, she joined United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Relationships Initially, Amisha has been in a relationship with the director Vikram Bhatt since 2002. They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008. This relationship also continued for less than two years, and she spoke about her breakup in an interview in 2010 as the reason to focus on her career. Now, she is unmarried and possibly single. Controversies In 2006, a police complaint was filed against her by an employee of Air India for misbehaviour by her.

Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further. After 2007, her career graph was going ups and downs. She did just a handful of films, like only one in 2018 and a few in 2011, 2013, and 2016. In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001. In 2004, she did her second world tour, Craze, with Hrithik, Lara Dutta, and Saif Ali Khan. She was also part of Kuch Dil Se…, a Bollywood star show.

In the same year, she also performed at the promotional event of Akshay Kumar's movie Chandani Chowk to China, on Christmas with Akshay, Bipasa Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Riya Sen, Himesh Reshammiya, and Bohemia. Social Work Amisha always tried to help the society that gave her all the fame throughout her acting. In 2005, she did a stage performance to raise money for the victims hit by Tsunami Earthquake in 2004, along with other Indian stars.

In 2006, she joined PlanetRead, an NGO that helps villagers to read through songs. In 2007, she decided to raise awareness about human trafficking in the country. For that, she joined United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Relationships Initially, Amisha has been in a relationship with the director Vikram Bhatt since 2002. They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008.

She has a cute, innocent face and good acting skills. The blockbuster movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai" was Amisha's debut movie opposite Hrithik Roshan in 2000. She did numerous Hindi and other regional language movies and won two Filmfare for her first two movies. Amisha came to Bollywood as a cute actress and built her image as one of the sexiest actresses in Bollywood. She accepted challenging roles and transformed herself per the position's requirements, showing her hard work and persistence to remain in the industry. Personal Life Amisha was born on 9 June 1975 in a Gujarati family in Mumbai. Her father, Amit Patel, is a businessman, and her mother, Asha Patel, is a housewife. Amisha got her name from the confluence of her parents' names, Am from Amit and Sha from Asha, making Amisha. Amisha was born and brought up in Mumbai. Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a recognized lawyer and politician. In particular, he was the president of the Congress Pradesh Committee, Mumbai. Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films. Some notable movies of Amisha are listed in below table: Year Movie 2002 Aap Mujhe Acche Lagne Lage 2002 Kranti 2002 Yeh Hai Jalwa 2002 Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai 2003 Humraz 2003 Pudhiya Geethai (Tamil) 2004 Parwana 2004 Suno Sasurjee 2005 Naani (Telugu) 2005 Vaada 2005 Elaan 2005 Mangal Pandey: The Rising 2005 Zameer: The Fire Within 2005 Narasimhudu (Telugu) 2006 Mere Jeevan Sathi 2006 Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai 2006 Teesri Aankh: The Hidden Camera 2006 Tathastu 2006 Aankhen 2006 Aap Ki Khatir 2007 Honeymoon Travels Pvt.

The first project under her production is Desi Magic, which is still unreleased due to some legal issues. Struggle Phase The phase during 2003 to 2006 was very hard for Amisha. Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further. After 2007, her career graph was going ups and downs. She did just a handful of films, like only one in 2018 and a few in 2011, 2013, and 2016. In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001. In 2004, she did her second world tour, Craze, with Hrithik, Lara Dutta, and Saif Ali Khan. She was also part of Kuch Dil Se…, a Bollywood star show.

In the same year, she also performed at the promotional event of Akshay Kumar's movie Chandani Chowk to China, on Christmas with Akshay, Bipasa Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Riya Sen, Himesh Reshammiya, and Bohemia. Social Work Amisha always tried to help the society that gave her all the fame throughout her acting. In 2005, she did a stage performance to raise money for the victims hit by Tsunami Earthquake in 2004, along with other Indian stars. In the same year, she also performed at Temptations 2005, a charity event organized by the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP) in New Delhi. In 2004, she joined PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), an organization that works for the welfare of animals. In 2006, she joined PlanetRead, an NGO that helps villagers to read through songs. In 2007, she decided to raise awareness about human trafficking in the country. For that, she joined United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Relationships Initially, Amisha has been in a relationship with the director Vikram Bhatt since 2002. They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008. This relationship also continued for less than two years, and she spoke about her breakup in an interview in 2010 as the reason to focus on her career. Now, she is unmarried and possibly single.

She has a cute, innocent face and good acting skills. The blockbuster movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai" was Amisha's debut movie opposite Hrithik Roshan in 2000. She did numerous Hindi and other regional language movies and won two Filmfare for her first two movies. Amisha came to Bollywood as a cute actress and built her image as one of the sexiest actresses in Bollywood. She accepted challenging roles and transformed herself per the position's requirements, showing her hard work and persistence to remain in the industry. Personal Life Amisha was born on 9 June 1975 in a Gujarati family in Mumbai. Her father, Amit Patel, is a businessman, and her mother, Asha Patel, is a housewife. Amisha got her name from the confluence of her parents' names, Am from Amit and Sha from Asha, making Amisha. Amisha was born and brought up in Mumbai. Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a recognized lawyer and politician. In particular, he was the president of the Congress Pradesh Committee, Mumbai. Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films. Some notable movies of Amisha are listed in below table: Year Movie 2002 Aap Mujhe Acche Lagne Lage 2002 Kranti 2002 Yeh Hai Jalwa 2002 Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai 2003 Humraz 2003 Pudhiya Geethai (Tamil) 2004 Parwana 2004 Suno Sasurjee 2005 Naani (Telugu) 2005 Vaada 2005 Elaan 2005 Mangal Pandey: The Rising 2005 Zameer: The Fire Within 2005 Narasimhudu (Telugu) 2006 Mere Jeevan Sathi 2006 Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai 2006 Teesri Aankh: The Hidden Camera 2006 Tathastu 2006 Aankhen 2006 Aap Ki Khatir 2007 Honeymoon Travels Pvt.

The first project under her production is Desi Magic, which is still unreleased due to some legal issues. Struggle Phase The phase during 2003 to 2006 was very hard for Amisha. Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful. These were the years when she saw no revival and faced back-to-back flops. It was her struggling phase, and she almost saw herself out of Bollywood. 2007 was the year of revival for her. Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further. After 2007, her career graph was going ups and downs. She did just a handful of films, like only one in 2018 and a few in 2011, 2013, and 2016. In a move to revive her career, she participated in the 13th season of Big Boss, but this did not help her much in getting public support. The Way Forward There are some projects in the process that she hopes to do well in those, like Gadar 2: The Katha Continues and Mystery of Tattoo, whose shooting is going on. Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage. Projects other than Movies Amisha performed in various stage performances in India and abroad. She served on her maiden world tour with Hrithik Roshan, The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert, in 2001. In 2004, she did her second world tour, Craze, with Hrithik, Lara Dutta, and Saif Ali Khan. She was also part of Kuch Dil Se…, a Bollywood star show.

In the same year, she also performed at the promotional event of Akshay Kumar's movie Chandani Chowk to China, on Christmas with Akshay, Bipasa Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Riya Sen, Himesh Reshammiya, and Bohemia. Social Work Amisha always tried to help the society that gave her all the fame throughout her acting. In 2005, she did a stage performance to raise money for the victims hit by Tsunami Earthquake in 2004, along with other Indian stars. In the same year, she also performed at Temptations 2005, a charity event organized by the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP) in New Delhi.

In 2006, she joined PlanetRead, an NGO that helps villagers to read through songs. In 2007, she decided to raise awareness about human trafficking in the country. For that, she joined United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Relationships Initially, Amisha has been in a relationship with the director Vikram Bhatt since 2002. They met each other on the set of the movie Aap Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage. The relationship continued for around five years. Their relationship created differences between the families of Patel and Bhatt. In 2008, the news of their breakup was confirmed. After that, Kanav Puri came into her life. He was a London-based businessman. The couple was spotted publicly in a fashion show in March 2008, and Amisha also confirmed her relationship in June 2008. This relationship also continued for less than two years, and she spoke about her breakup in an interview in 2010 as the reason to focus on her career. Now, she is unmarried and possibly single. Controversies In 2006, a police complaint was filed against her by an employee of Air India for misbehaviour by her. He complained that she was angry for not upgrading the seat of her companion to first class on Mumbai- New York flight. When she returned from the USA, she claimed that all the allegations were false. Later, the matter was resolved by the event organizers, for which she went to the USA.

Amisha Patel is the sister of Bollywood actor Ashmit Patel. Her family was well-established in Mumbai and had good relations with the Indian film industry families. Amisha completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School. She was good in her studies and decided to pursue Bio-genetic Engineering at Tufts University in the USA. But after two years, she changed her mind and switched to Economics. She graduated as a gold medallist. After that, she joined her first job at Khandwala Securities ltd. as an economic analyst. She was trained in Bharatnatyam dance form when she was five years old. Amisha's Acting Career Amisha's move toward Acting Initially, Amisha's parents were not inclined toward letting Amisha act. For their sake, Amisha worked with a firm for quite some time, but she realized she was not happy with that. So, she joined a theatre group by Satyadev Dubey and started doing plays. In 1999, she acted in an Urdu play called Neelam, which her parents also saw, and it showed them that their daughter could do something in the acting field. So, they gave her permission and even encouraged her to try acting in films. Amisha's Film Debut Rakesh Roshan and Amit, the father of Amisha, were old friends from the time of their boarding school. One day, Rakesh saw Amisha dancing at a party and told her father that he would like to launch his son Hrithik with Amisha. At that time, she was just 16 years old; however, Amisha's father denied it. Later Rakesh finalized Kareena Kapoor for the film, but again during a family lunch, Rakesh asked her for the role. Now, she agreed and replaced Kareena in the movie "Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai". This is how she got her debut film and won the Filmfare best actress debut award in 2000. After that, she did a Telugu film Badri with Pawan Kalyan, which also performed very well at the box office. In 2001, she did her second big Bollywood film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, opposite Sunny Deol. She played the role of a Pakistani Muslim girl, and it was also a high-grossing film. She got this role way before her debut movie was released, giving around a 12-hour-long audition for this role. Later, she was awarded Filmfare Special Performance Award for this role. Afterwards, the sequence of her movies started, and she gave a mix of successful and unsuccessful films.

Her career growth declined rapidly with a limited number of offers in 2003. She did only two films that year and also appeared in only one film in 2004. Though, these were good projects but could not perform well at the box office. In 2005, she did four films, but none did well earnings. Her six films in 2006 were also unsuccessful.

Her film "Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd." did well, and the audience accepted and praised her role. In the same year, she appeared as Radha in Bhool Bhulaiyaa. It was a big success, and she was greatly appreciated in the role of Radha. From here, her career got momentum again, and she appeared in various moderate performing films and paved her way further.

Her home production film and most awaited Desi Magic is at the post-production stage. Tauba Tera Jalwa and The Great Indian Casino are also at the post-production stage.
