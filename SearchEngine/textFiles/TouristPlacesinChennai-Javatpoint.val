Many tales and myths surround Vadapalani Murugan Temple, particularly those surrounding its founder and first priest, Annaswamy Naikar.

This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals. Scuba diving is a breath-taking pastime that provides you with those much-needed underwater thrills. With its pure water and stunning underwater landscape, including historic shipwrecks and lush plant life, Covelong Beach is the ideal location for scuba diving in Chennai. The cost would be INR 6000 per person(approx.) 2. Parasailing Consider it twice if you think Chennai is only known for its elegant temples and calm beaches. Parasailing is among the most adventurous sports in the world and is available in Chennai. This water sport, unlike many others, is not for the faint-hearted. Parasailing allows you to soar above the waves with a properly strapped parachute attached to your back. As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.

This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals. Scuba diving is a breath-taking pastime that provides you with those much-needed underwater thrills. With its pure water and stunning underwater landscape, including historic shipwrecks and lush plant life, Covelong Beach is the ideal location for scuba diving in Chennai. The cost would be INR 6000 per person(approx.) 2. Parasailing Consider it twice if you think Chennai is only known for its elegant temples and calm beaches. Parasailing is among the most adventurous sports in the world and is available in Chennai. This water sport, unlike many others, is not for the faint-hearted. Parasailing allows you to soar above the waves with a properly strapped parachute attached to your back. As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.

The Chola monarchy later preserved and popularised the temple in the 11th century. It is now one of Chennai's most popular tourist destinations, attracting pilgrims from the country. The temple's prasadam, a mixture of sacred ash, water, and milk, is said to be a cure-all for all diseases and afflictions. Lord Marundeeswarar, according to religious texts, educated the renowned Sage Agastya about the therapeutic use of several plants. As a result, a large number of people come here to seek blessings and to be cured of their diseases. The temple's prasad is also said to have medicinal properties. 4.

Madras War Memorial The Madras War Memorial honours the Second World War martyrs. It is one of Chennai's most renowned tourist sites, featuring well-kept gardens and structures built out of white stone with information about those who died in World War II. The best time to come is around Army Day or Vijay Diwas, when you can observe the military's particular commitment to the martyrs. 7. Arignar Anna Zoological Park For animal lovers, this is a definite must-see. It is home to over 500 distinct species, most of which are threatened with extinction.

The ocean waves echo throughout the temple premises, instantly calming visitors. The temple was rebuilt for almost 7 million rupees, with over 1.6 million rupees spent on performing a spiritually significant Hindu ceremony known as Jeernotharana Ashtabandana Mahakumbhabhishekam, demonstrating the temple's magnificence. 11. Government Museum The Government Museum, founded in 1851, is the country's 2nd oldest museum, after the Indian Museum in Kolkata.

The film city has a film school, indoor and outdoor shooting locations, replicas of the village and urban areas, post office, police station, prison, courtroom, and beautiful gardens in Italian, Japanese, and Mughal styles, in addition to being the best place to catch a glimpse of a popular Tamil actor. 13. Nettukuppam Nettukuppam is Chennai's northernmost tip, featuring a beach that crowds haven't discovered. It's a quiet hideaway for those who like to get up and personal with the rushing river while in a calm environment. Ennore's salty stream meets the sea here, making a type of estuary; because it is still off the usual tourist road, the setting is ideal for a relaxed holiday. There are no loud hawkers here, and the beach is devoid of tourists. It receives a greater number during holiday seasons or festivals; however, most of the time, very few groups of people are present. This is the perfect place to unwind on a warm evening if you prefer a calm and quiet environment. You will enjoy your stay at Nettukuppam beach by sitting on the bridge with your legs hanging, taking in the sea wind and cool mist as the waves crash against the pier and splash into the white foam below your feet. 14. Vadapalani Murugan Temple One of the most renowned temples devoted to Lord Murugan is Vadapalani Murugan Temple. The temple, located in Vadapalani, Chennai, is recognised for assisting worshippers in finding solutions to life's issues. People come here to help with marital, intellectual, and professional issues. Many devotees report that coming here to pray has helped them overcome their problems and find serenity in their lives. Worshipping Lord Murugan is likewise seen to be equally devout as worshipping him at the original Palani temple. If people cannot worship at Murugan's native abode, they may do it here, and Murugan will still shower blessing on them. Many tales and myths surround Vadapalani Murugan Temple, particularly those surrounding its founder and first priest, Annaswamy Naikar. He dreamed about this deed he needed to do for his welfare and the good of society, so instead of looking for Lord Murugan elsewhere, he began worshipping him at home. This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal?

The film city has a film school, indoor and outdoor shooting locations, replicas of the village and urban areas, post office, police station, prison, courtroom, and beautiful gardens in Italian, Japanese, and Mughal styles, in addition to being the best place to catch a glimpse of a popular Tamil actor. 13. Nettukuppam Nettukuppam is Chennai's northernmost tip, featuring a beach that crowds haven't discovered. It's a quiet hideaway for those who like to get up and personal with the rushing river while in a calm environment. Ennore's salty stream meets the sea here, making a type of estuary; because it is still off the usual tourist road, the setting is ideal for a relaxed holiday. There are no loud hawkers here, and the beach is devoid of tourists. It receives a greater number during holiday seasons or festivals; however, most of the time, very few groups of people are present. This is the perfect place to unwind on a warm evening if you prefer a calm and quiet environment. You will enjoy your stay at Nettukuppam beach by sitting on the bridge with your legs hanging, taking in the sea wind and cool mist as the waves crash against the pier and splash into the white foam below your feet. 14. Vadapalani Murugan Temple One of the most renowned temples devoted to Lord Murugan is Vadapalani Murugan Temple. The temple, located in Vadapalani, Chennai, is recognised for assisting worshippers in finding solutions to life's issues. People come here to help with marital, intellectual, and professional issues. Many devotees report that coming here to pray has helped them overcome their problems and find serenity in their lives. Worshipping Lord Murugan is likewise seen to be equally devout as worshipping him at the original Palani temple. If people cannot worship at Murugan's native abode, they may do it here, and Murugan will still shower blessing on them. Many tales and myths surround Vadapalani Murugan Temple, particularly those surrounding its founder and first priest, Annaswamy Naikar. He dreamed about this deed he needed to do for his welfare and the good of society, so instead of looking for Lord Murugan elsewhere, he began worshipping him at home. This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals. Scuba diving is a breath-taking pastime that provides you with those much-needed underwater thrills. With its pure water and stunning underwater landscape, including historic shipwrecks and lush plant life, Covelong Beach is the ideal location for scuba diving in Chennai. The cost would be INR 6000 per person(approx.) 2. Parasailing Consider it twice if you think Chennai is only known for its elegant temples and calm beaches. Parasailing is among the most adventurous sports in the world and is available in Chennai. This water sport, unlike many others, is not for the faint-hearted. Parasailing allows you to soar above the waves with a properly strapped parachute attached to your back. As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.

Many tales and myths surround Vadapalani Murugan Temple, particularly those surrounding its founder and first priest, Annaswamy Naikar.

The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals.

Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals.

Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.

As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable.

When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.

The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals. Scuba diving is a breath-taking pastime that provides you with those much-needed underwater thrills. With its pure water and stunning underwater landscape, including historic shipwrecks and lush plant life, Covelong Beach is the ideal location for scuba diving in Chennai. The cost would be INR 6000 per person(approx.) 2. Parasailing Consider it twice if you think Chennai is only known for its elegant temples and calm beaches. Parasailing is among the most adventurous sports in the world and is available in Chennai. This water sport, unlike many others, is not for the faint-hearted. Parasailing allows you to soar above the waves with a properly strapped parachute attached to your back. As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation.

He dreamed about this deed he needed to do for his welfare and the good of society, so instead of looking for Lord Murugan elsewhere, he began worshipping him at home. This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals. Scuba diving is a breath-taking pastime that provides you with those much-needed underwater thrills. With its pure water and stunning underwater landscape, including historic shipwrecks and lush plant life, Covelong Beach is the ideal location for scuba diving in Chennai. The cost would be INR 6000 per person(approx.) 2. Parasailing Consider it twice if you think Chennai is only known for its elegant temples and calm beaches. Parasailing is among the most adventurous sports in the world and is available in Chennai. This water sport, unlike many others, is not for the faint-hearted. Parasailing allows you to soar above the waves with a properly strapped parachute attached to your back. As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.

The Chola monarchy later preserved and popularised the temple in the 11th century. It is now one of Chennai's most popular tourist destinations, attracting pilgrims from the country. The temple's prasadam, a mixture of sacred ash, water, and milk, is said to be a cure-all for all diseases and afflictions. Lord Marundeeswarar, according to religious texts, educated the renowned Sage Agastya about the therapeutic use of several plants. As a result, a large number of people come here to seek blessings and to be cured of their diseases. The temple's prasad is also said to have medicinal properties. 4.

Madras War Memorial The Madras War Memorial honours the Second World War martyrs. It is one of Chennai's most renowned tourist sites, featuring well-kept gardens and structures built out of white stone with information about those who died in World War II. The best time to come is around Army Day or Vijay Diwas, when you can observe the military's particular commitment to the martyrs. 7. Arignar Anna Zoological Park For animal lovers, this is a definite must-see. It is home to over 500 distinct species, most of which are threatened with extinction.

The ocean waves echo throughout the temple premises, instantly calming visitors.

The film city has a film school, indoor and outdoor shooting locations, replicas of the village and urban areas, post office, police station, prison, courtroom, and beautiful gardens in Italian, Japanese, and Mughal styles, in addition to being the best place to catch a glimpse of a popular Tamil actor. 13. Nettukuppam Nettukuppam is Chennai's northernmost tip, featuring a beach that crowds haven't discovered. It's a quiet hideaway for those who like to get up and personal with the rushing river while in a calm environment. Ennore's salty stream meets the sea here, making a type of estuary; because it is still off the usual tourist road, the setting is ideal for a relaxed holiday. There are no loud hawkers here, and the beach is devoid of tourists. It receives a greater number during holiday seasons or festivals; however, most of the time, very few groups of people are present. This is the perfect place to unwind on a warm evening if you prefer a calm and quiet environment. You will enjoy your stay at Nettukuppam beach by sitting on the bridge with your legs hanging, taking in the sea wind and cool mist as the waves crash against the pier and splash into the white foam below your feet. 14. Vadapalani Murugan Temple One of the most renowned temples devoted to Lord Murugan is Vadapalani Murugan Temple. The temple, located in Vadapalani, Chennai, is recognised for assisting worshippers in finding solutions to life's issues. People come here to help with marital, intellectual, and professional issues. Many devotees report that coming here to pray has helped them overcome their problems and find serenity in their lives. Worshipping Lord Murugan is likewise seen to be equally devout as worshipping him at the original Palani temple. If people cannot worship at Murugan's native abode, they may do it here, and Murugan will still shower blessing on them. Many tales and myths surround Vadapalani Murugan Temple, particularly those surrounding its founder and first priest, Annaswamy Naikar. He dreamed about this deed he needed to do for his welfare and the good of society, so instead of looking for Lord Murugan elsewhere, he began worshipping him at home. This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1.

The film city has a film school, indoor and outdoor shooting locations, replicas of the village and urban areas, post office, police station, prison, courtroom, and beautiful gardens in Italian, Japanese, and Mughal styles, in addition to being the best place to catch a glimpse of a popular Tamil actor. 13. Nettukuppam Nettukuppam is Chennai's northernmost tip, featuring a beach that crowds haven't discovered. It's a quiet hideaway for those who like to get up and personal with the rushing river while in a calm environment. Ennore's salty stream meets the sea here, making a type of estuary; because it is still off the usual tourist road, the setting is ideal for a relaxed holiday. There are no loud hawkers here, and the beach is devoid of tourists. It receives a greater number during holiday seasons or festivals; however, most of the time, very few groups of people are present. This is the perfect place to unwind on a warm evening if you prefer a calm and quiet environment.

The temple, located in Vadapalani, Chennai, is recognised for assisting worshippers in finding solutions to life's issues. People come here to help with marital, intellectual, and professional issues. Many devotees report that coming here to pray has helped them overcome their problems and find serenity in their lives. Worshipping Lord Murugan is likewise seen to be equally devout as worshipping him at the original Palani temple. If people cannot worship at Murugan's native abode, they may do it here, and Murugan will still shower blessing on them. Many tales and myths surround Vadapalani Murugan Temple, particularly those surrounding its founder and first priest, Annaswamy Naikar. He dreamed about this deed he needed to do for his welfare and the good of society, so instead of looking for Lord Murugan elsewhere, he began worshipping him at home. This modest shrine was subsequently developed into the huge concept you see today, complete with several deities. If you go to the temple on one of the major festival days, you'll notice how popular Murugan is in this place. 15. Kolli Hills The Kolli Hills, also called Kolli Malai, are a mountainous region in Tamil Nadu's Namakkal region renowned as the "Mountain of Death." Almost all of its natural beauty has been retained because it has been virtually undisturbed by commercial tourists. The mountains are recognized not just for their natural scenery but also for their religious importance, thanks to the Arappaleshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The summit is also reachable by car, albeit the route going up is treacherous and full of twists and turns. There are adventurous activities also which tourists can do at some places, which are: 1. Scuba Diving In the summer, Chennai can get fairly hot, and avoiding the heat would be the first concern. Why not dive someplace off the coastline of Chennai in the Bay of Bengal? The best thing about Chennai is discovering a completely new world beneath the sea's surface while also cooling down. The wonderful chance to dive into the pristine blue waters of the ocean and enjoy the enchanting life of the marine animals. Scuba diving is a breath-taking pastime that provides you with those much-needed underwater thrills. With its pure water and stunning underwater landscape, including historic shipwrecks and lush plant life, Covelong Beach is the ideal location for scuba diving in Chennai. The cost would be INR 6000 per person(approx.) 2. Parasailing Consider it twice if you think Chennai is only known for its elegant temples and calm beaches. Parasailing is among the most adventurous sports in the world and is available in Chennai. This water sport, unlike many others, is not for the faint-hearted. Parasailing allows you to soar above the waves with a properly strapped parachute attached to your back. As the forward-moving motor speed boat supplies the parachute with air, the participant may admire the turquoise blue sea. Local businesses provide parasailing activities on the Covelong and Marina beaches, and the fee is around INR 2000 per person (approx.) Best Time to Visit Chennai From March to early July, the weather is unsuitable for travellers in Chennai. The tropical environment of Chennai makes the summertime heat nearly intolerable. Going outside in the afternoon is not advised since it is hot and humid. It is also not a good idea to visit sites around Chennai during this time. When the weather in Chennai cools down after the monsoon, it's the greatest time to organise your vacation. The weather is good between October and early February, making it a great time to see the finest tourist attractions in Chennai and arrange vacations to surrounding destinations like Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry.
