The weather is good at the starting of the winter, but temperatures drop dramatically throughout the peak season. During the winter, you may visit the state without dealing with the oppressive heat or rain. Visiting tourist attractions around this time is a pleasurable experience. Visiting the state during summer is not suggested since the temperature is scorching hot. However, travelling here during the monsoon season can be a fantastic idea too.
