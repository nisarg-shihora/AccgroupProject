She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career.

She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor.

Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security.

While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security. The Reality Show Sob Stories Debate After appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films during her career, Parineeti Chopra made the decision to move into the television industry in January 2022.

While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies. She supported the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organization devoted to uplifting girls, by walking the runway at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security. The Reality Show Sob Stories Debate After appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films during her career, Parineeti Chopra made the decision to move into the television industry in January 2022.

While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies. She supported the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organization devoted to uplifting girls, by walking the runway at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security.

While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career.

Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor.

After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently.

Modi's security.

While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks.

Her strong desire to learn and love for music led her to pursue a B.A. Honors degree in music. She is, in fact, a trained Hindustani traditional singer. She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor. Her work, again, was lauded by a number of experts. Chopra's most recent film was Saina, a biographical sports film on the renowned badminton player Saina Nehwal. Her portrayal as Saina was yet again praised by critics. Parineeti debuted in the television world by appearing as a mentor in Zee TV's India's Best Cinestar Ki Khoj in 2014.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security. The Reality Show Sob Stories Debate After appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films during her career, Parineeti Chopra made the decision to move into the television industry in January 2022. The actress debuted as a reality TV show judge on Hunarbaaz: Desh Ki Shaan which aired on Colors besides Mithun Chakraborty and Karan Johar as co-judges.

Former judges or competitors had also spoken out about the matter, starting with Sunidhi Chauhan and ending with Abhijeet Sawant. While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies. She supported the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organization devoted to uplifting girls, by walking the runway at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week.

Her strong desire to learn and love for music led her to pursue a B.A. Honors degree in music. She is, in fact, a trained Hindustani traditional singer. She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor. Her work, again, was lauded by a number of experts. Chopra's most recent film was Saina, a biographical sports film on the renowned badminton player Saina Nehwal. Her portrayal as Saina was yet again praised by critics. Parineeti debuted in the television world by appearing as a mentor in Zee TV's India's Best Cinestar Ki Khoj in 2014.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security. The Reality Show Sob Stories Debate After appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films during her career, Parineeti Chopra made the decision to move into the television industry in January 2022. The actress debuted as a reality TV show judge on Hunarbaaz: Desh Ki Shaan which aired on Colors besides Mithun Chakraborty and Karan Johar as co-judges. The show that received the most criticism for its romantic and emotional aspects was Indian Idol 12. Former judges or competitors had also spoken out about the matter, starting with Sunidhi Chauhan and ending with Abhijeet Sawant. While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies. She supported the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organization devoted to uplifting girls, by walking the runway at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security.

The actress debuted as a reality TV show judge on Hunarbaaz: Desh Ki Shaan which aired on Colors besides Mithun Chakraborty and Karan Johar as co-judges.

Former judges or competitors had also spoken out about the matter, starting with Sunidhi Chauhan and ending with Abhijeet Sawant. While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks.

She studied Business, Finance, and Economics at Manchester Business School and graduated with a triple honors degree. She confessed in an interview with the Hindu newspaper that she was an excellent student who aspired to be an investment banker. Her strong desire to learn and love for music led her to pursue a B.A. Honors degree in music. She is, in fact, a trained Hindustani traditional singer. She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor. Her work, again, was lauded by a number of experts. Chopra's most recent film was Saina, a biographical sports film on the renowned badminton player Saina Nehwal. Her portrayal as Saina was yet again praised by critics. Parineeti debuted in the television world by appearing as a mentor in Zee TV's India's Best Cinestar Ki Khoj in 2014. In 2015, she starred in the Star Plus documentary Girl Rising - Woh Padhegi, Woh Udegi, which aired on Raksha Bandhan.

In March 2022, she featured as a participant on Colors' show, Khatra Khatra Khatra.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security. The Reality Show Sob Stories Debate After appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films during her career, Parineeti Chopra made the decision to move into the television industry in January 2022. The actress debuted as a reality TV show judge on Hunarbaaz: Desh Ki Shaan which aired on Colors besides Mithun Chakraborty and Karan Johar as co-judges. The show that received the most criticism for its romantic and emotional aspects was Indian Idol 12. Former judges or competitors had also spoken out about the matter, starting with Sunidhi Chauhan and ending with Abhijeet Sawant. While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor. Her work, again, was lauded by a number of experts. Chopra's most recent film was Saina, a biographical sports film on the renowned badminton player Saina Nehwal. Her portrayal as Saina was yet again praised by critics. Parineeti debuted in the television world by appearing as a mentor in Zee TV's India's Best Cinestar Ki Khoj in 2014.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security.

The actress debuted as a reality TV show judge on Hunarbaaz: Desh Ki Shaan which aired on Colors besides Mithun Chakraborty and Karan Johar as co-judges. The show that received the most criticism for its romantic and emotional aspects was Indian Idol 12. Former judges or competitors had also spoken out about the matter, starting with Sunidhi Chauhan and ending with Abhijeet Sawant. While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala.

She used to perform on stage with Priyanka Chopra Jonas when she was younger. Her Acting and Music Career Parineeti Chopra's adventure in Bollywood began in 2009 when she returned to India during a period of economic crisis. She went back to work as a public relations consultant for Yash Raj Films Production. She afterward was offered by the company a contract as an actor. In 2011, she made her acting debut in the film 'Ladies versus Ricky Bahl' (a romantic comedy-drama starring Ranveer Singh), which was a box office triumph.

Although Chopra's work was acclaimed, the movie got mixed feedback from critics. Chopra's subsequent glitzy performance was in 2014's crime drama Kill Dil, which also featured actors Govinda, Ranveer Singh, and Ali Zafar. Neither Daawat-e-Ishq nor Kill Dil could do magic for viewers and were no less than disappointments for Chopra's career. Chopra then decided to take a break from work and only featured in a brief comic appearance as a doctor in the Man's World youtube series and as Muskaan Raza Qureshi in Dishoom, wherein she was featured in a song "Jaaneman Aah." Chopra reappeared to the films in 2017 in Yash Raj Films' Meri Pyaari Bindu, with Ayushmann Khurana, following her three-year hiatus from working in cinema. She then appeared in Rohit Shetty's comical drama Golmaal Again, the fourth edition in the Golmaal film series, with Ajay Devgn. The film shattered multiple records and was dubbed a smash hit, making it the highest-grossing picture of her career. Chopra's sole film released in 2018 was the rom-com Namaste England, in which she co-starred opposite Arjun Kapoor. Following Ishaqzaade, this was Chopra's second association opposite Arjun Kapoor. The movie failed terribly at box office and was also not praised by critics. Chopra then appeared in a supporting role beside Akshay Kumar in Anurag Singh's epic battle thriller Kesari in 2019. The movie recounted the series of events that led to the Battle of Saragarhi. The movie turned out to be financially profitable for the makers. Her second project of the year was Jabariya Jodi, a rom-com drama starring Sidharth Malhotra. The movie was centered on Bihar's rampant practice of bridegroom abduction. The movie was critically panned and proved to be a disaster. Chopra then starred in The Girl on the Train, a Hindi version of a British film and an adaptation of a novel with the same title, which was released in February 2021. Her portrayal as Mira was well received by critics. Chopra then acted in Dibakar Banerjee's dark comedy Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar alongside Arjun Kapoor. Her work, again, was lauded by a number of experts. Chopra's most recent film was Saina, a biographical sports film on the renowned badminton player Saina Nehwal. Her portrayal as Saina was yet again praised by critics. Parineeti debuted in the television world by appearing as a mentor in Zee TV's India's Best Cinestar Ki Khoj in 2014.

She performed an acoustic rendition of the song "Matlabi Yariyan" in 2021. Controversies The Saina Nehwal Fiasco In January 2022, when Indian Badminton star Saina Nehwal tweeted condemning the lapse in the security of PM Narendra Modi in Punjab, she received a derogatory and sexist joke in response to it by south actor Siddharth which didn't go down well with her fans. After actor Sidharth eventually apologized to Saina following the backlash he received online for his comment, one would have believed that Sidharth's apology would put an end to the matter, but they would be mistaken since Parineeti Chopra was brought into the fray by those who weren't persuaded. As Parineeti portrayed Saina in her biopic movie "Saina" in March 2021 wherein the movie explored Saina's relationship with her parents as well as gender-related stigmas in our culture. People were furious because Parineeti did not defend Saina when Siddharth made inappropriate comments against a person whom she portrayed on screen recently. She was heavily criticized for her hypocrisy by the public and branded all the Bollywood celebrities as egotistical individuals. A Twitter user penned the following: Parineeti Chopra portrayed Saina Nehwal's character in the movie yet she didn't voice a single thing when her industry colleague Siddharth uttered disparaging remarks toward Saina merely because she was worried about P.M. Modi's security. The Reality Show Sob Stories Debate After appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films during her career, Parineeti Chopra made the decision to move into the television industry in January 2022. The actress debuted as a reality TV show judge on Hunarbaaz: Desh Ki Shaan which aired on Colors besides Mithun Chakraborty and Karan Johar as co-judges. The show that received the most criticism for its romantic and emotional aspects was Indian Idol 12. Former judges or competitors had also spoken out about the matter, starting with Sunidhi Chauhan and ending with Abhijeet Sawant. While she was on the way to her debut appearance on television as a judge, Parineeti Chopra said to print media when asked to comment on the debate going on, that she thinks individuals who are not familiar with reality shows act like that. She shared her personal details from her experiences and said they never receive a script or instructions on what to say. She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine.

She further added that the participants are unknown to them and they react to their acts as they unfold. Parineeti further remarked that when there is an emotional narrative on the show, why wouldn't they tell that? The contestants only get a single shot to perform, and the ability is genuine. The reality in the show is quite true. Trolled for Her Weight and Looks The Bollywood actress has frequently engaged in verbal combat with these haters. Online trolls made fun of Parineeti when she posted a few photos from her trip to Australia on her Instagram handle and one of the photos showed the actress cuddling up to a Koala. Some chose to make fun of her pouty look by stating that the Koala and she looked like siblings while another attempted to body shame her by remarking, that her face looked like a koala in the picture and that she should give up dieting. Parineeti had previously discussed her challenges of coping with body-image concerns and that she just laughs it all out when she is attacked by such trolls for her weight or looks. Social Work Chopra is involved in charity work and promotes a lot of organizations in addition to performing in movies. She supported the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, a non-profit organization devoted to uplifting girls, by walking the runway at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. In order to show her support, she also made an appearance on NDTV's Greenathon, a campaign to promote environmental responsibility and look into the inadequate power supply in rural areas. In 2015, the state government of Haryana named Chopra as the brand ambassador for the "Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao" initiative to advance the rights of girls. Brand Endorsements Parineeti works with a variety of brands as an ambassador in addition to her charitable efforts. WeChat, Pantene, Mahindra Scotty, Kurkure, Nivea, Maaza, and Spinz are just a few of the companies that Chopra either supports currently or had endorsed in the past. She made history as the first Bollywood celebrity to simultaneously promote PepsiCo's Kurkure and Coke's Maaza. Chopra represents ADEX India as its brand ambassador. In 2017, Chopra joined Tourism Australia's 'Friends of Australia' advocacy team and was named an ambassador. The number of Indian tourists visiting Australia has increased by an average of 21% following Chopra's appointment, compared to a growth of 15% over the previous six months, as per the India Entertainment Marketing Report 2019.
