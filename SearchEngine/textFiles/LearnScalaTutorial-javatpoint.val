Scala Tutorial Scala tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Scala. Our Scala tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language. Our Scala tutorial includes all topics of Scala language such as datatype, conditional expressions, comments, functions, examples on oops concepts, constructors, method overloading, this keyword, inheritance, final, exception handling, file handling, tuples, string, string interpolation, case classes, singleton objects, collection etc. What is Scala Scala is a general-purpose programming language. It supports object oriented, functional and imperative programming approaches. It is a strong static type language. In scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. It does not have concept of primitive data. It was designed by Martin Odersky. It was officially released for java platform in early 2004 and for .Net framework in June 2004. Later on, Scala dropped .Net support in 2012. Scala is influenced by Java, Haskell, Lisp, Pizza etc. and influenced to F#, Fantom, Red etc. File extension of scala source file may be either .scala or .sc. You can create any kind of application like web application, enterprise application, mobile application, desktop based application etc. Scala Program Example Let's see the simple program of scala. A detailed description of this program is given in next chapters. 
object MainObject{
    def main(args:Array[String]){
		print("Hello Scala")
    }
}
 Where to use Scala Web applications Utilities and libraries Data streaming with Akka Parallel batch processing Concurrency and distributed application Data analysis with Spark AWS lambda expression Ad hoc scripting in REPL etc. In Scala, you can create any type of application in less time and coding whether it is web based, mobile based or desktop based application. Scala provides you powerful tools and API by using which you can create applications. Here, You can use play framework which provides a platform to build web application rapidly.

Scala Tutorial Scala tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Scala. Our Scala tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language. Our Scala tutorial includes all topics of Scala language such as datatype, conditional expressions, comments, functions, examples on oops concepts, constructors, method overloading, this keyword, inheritance, final, exception handling, file handling, tuples, string, string interpolation, case classes, singleton objects, collection etc. What is Scala Scala is a general-purpose programming language. It supports object oriented, functional and imperative programming approaches. It is a strong static type language. In scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. It does not have concept of primitive data. It was designed by Martin Odersky. It was officially released for java platform in early 2004 and for .Net framework in June 2004. Later on, Scala dropped .Net support in 2012. Scala is influenced by Java, Haskell, Lisp, Pizza etc. and influenced to F#, Fantom, Red etc. File extension of scala source file may be either .scala or .sc. You can create any kind of application like web application, enterprise application, mobile application, desktop based application etc. Scala Program Example Let's see the simple program of scala. A detailed description of this program is given in next chapters. 
object MainObject{
    def main(args:Array[String]){
		print("Hello Scala")
    }
}
 Where to use Scala Web applications Utilities and libraries Data streaming with Akka Parallel batch processing Concurrency and distributed application Data analysis with Spark AWS lambda expression Ad hoc scripting in REPL etc. In Scala, you can create any type of application in less time and coding whether it is web based, mobile based or desktop based application. Scala provides you powerful tools and API by using which you can create applications. Here, You can use play framework which provides a platform to build web application rapidly.

Scala Tutorial Scala tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Scala. Our Scala tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language. Our Scala tutorial includes all topics of Scala language such as datatype, conditional expressions, comments, functions, examples on oops concepts, constructors, method overloading, this keyword, inheritance, final, exception handling, file handling, tuples, string, string interpolation, case classes, singleton objects, collection etc. What is Scala Scala is a general-purpose programming language. It supports object oriented, functional and imperative programming approaches. It is a strong static type language. In scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. It does not have concept of primitive data. It was designed by Martin Odersky. It was officially released for java platform in early 2004 and for .Net framework in June 2004. Later on, Scala dropped .Net support in 2012. Scala is influenced by Java, Haskell, Lisp, Pizza etc. and influenced to F#, Fantom, Red etc. File extension of scala source file may be either .scala or .sc. You can create any kind of application like web application, enterprise application, mobile application, desktop based application etc. Scala Program Example Let's see the simple program of scala. A detailed description of this program is given in next chapters.

Our Scala tutorial includes all topics of Scala language such as datatype, conditional expressions, comments, functions, examples on oops concepts, constructors, method overloading, this keyword, inheritance, final, exception handling, file handling, tuples, string, string interpolation, case classes, singleton objects, collection etc. What is Scala Scala is a general-purpose programming language. It supports object oriented, functional and imperative programming approaches. It is a strong static type language. In scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. It does not have concept of primitive data. It was designed by Martin Odersky. It was officially released for java platform in early 2004 and for .Net framework in June 2004. Later on, Scala dropped .Net support in 2012. Scala is influenced by Java, Haskell, Lisp, Pizza etc. and influenced to F#, Fantom, Red etc. File extension of scala source file may be either .scala or .sc. You can create any kind of application like web application, enterprise application, mobile application, desktop based application etc. Scala Program Example Let's see the simple program of scala. A detailed description of this program is given in next chapters. 
object MainObject{
    def main(args:Array[String]){
		print("Hello Scala")
    }
}
 Where to use Scala Web applications Utilities and libraries Data streaming with Akka Parallel batch processing Concurrency and distributed application Data analysis with Spark AWS lambda expression Ad hoc scripting in REPL etc. In Scala, you can create any type of application in less time and coding whether it is web based, mobile based or desktop based application. Scala provides you powerful tools and API by using which you can create applications. Here, You can use play framework which provides a platform to build web application rapidly.
