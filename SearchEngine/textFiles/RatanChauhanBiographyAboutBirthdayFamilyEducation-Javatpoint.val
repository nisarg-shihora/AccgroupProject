Ratan didn't always look like a boy in her past; she attended school with other girls and wore her hair long like other girls. Ratan claims that she used to spend a lot of time making her hair when getting ready for school. Without hair braids, she was not allowed to attend school as the penalty was applicable in the classroom when braids were absent. Ratan participated in NCC and sports while attending college. When the long hair began bothering her a lot, she gave her a boyish haircut. When Ratan chopped her hair like a boy and returned home, her mother praised her new appearance and advised her to maintain it that way. After completing her time at school, Ratan continued her bachelor's degree with B.Com. She grew quite upset when Ratan experienced something during her B.Com and started creating videos on music to lift his spirits. Career Ratan began posting videos on TikTok only for fun.

When Ratan started making videos, several of them went viral, inspiring her to continue her journey.
