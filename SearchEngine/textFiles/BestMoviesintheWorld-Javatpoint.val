Shawshank Redemption The movie that comes to people's minds when we talk about the best movies in the world is Shawshank Redemption. It is no shock that it is the highest-ranked movie. The story revolves around the highly secured prison and the lives of prisoners living in there. Movies other than Shawshank redemption might not have pleasing moments but this movie will surely manage to surprise you with the greatly executed plot. The story was written by Stephen King who told the story of the titular prison and the center of the plant was a friendship between two inmates. The screen displayed the best relationship between two men which led to one of the best endings in the history of films. 2. Godfather part 2 The Godfather part 2 is the most praised film of all time and it comes in fair position on the list of IMDB. However, it is one of the highly acclaimed movies of that time but still could not be earned the mark of highest rank filmed in that trilogy. This honor goes directly to the original part. There has been a lot of debate and controversies on which part is better in the trilogy. Regardless of the debate, the film fan and critics feel safe to say they both are massive achievements in the cinematic universe. The story revolves around the Corleone family, an American -Italian mafia family who struggles with keeping their power alive after the peace and patriarch of the family gets disturbed.

However, that doesn't reflect in the film. The film is set mostly inside a juror's room as the debate in twelve men for a murder case that has just been overseen. They collectively put voices insisting the accused is innocent, and the film focuses on the life or death debate. While the visuals and graphics may seem dull, it was all set to make the movie look more sensible and intense. The director brilliantly makes the room look more and more confined as the debate turns into a rage. The small room gives it a more claustrophobic atmosphere. As the movie was made focusing on twelve men as a jury debating on a case of murder in a small courtroom shows that even a small-scale budget movie can also leave an impact on the audience. 5. Schindler's list Schindler's list was directed by Steven Spielberg who is an expert in creating great meaningful movies, and it was one of them. However, it is his most difficult to watch and that shows his perfection in the work he does as a director.

Spielberg created a film that will last in people's minds for years. 6. Interstellar The new gem in the cue is Christopher Nolan's Interstellar.
