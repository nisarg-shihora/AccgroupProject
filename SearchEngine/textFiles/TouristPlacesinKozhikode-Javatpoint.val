Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3.

This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris.

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3.

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9.

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3. Tali Shiva Temple Tali Shiva Temple is devoted to the Hindu god Shiva and is considered among the holiest places in Kozhikode. This temple was constructed in the fourteenth century by the Zamorins, and it is also the residence of Lord Ayappa. It is a widespread belief in Kozhikode that the spiritual purity of this temple is directly related to the city's economic success. There is a widespread belief among the faithful that Saint Parasuram was responsible for installing the main idol inside the temple. You will see that the idol is positioned like Sri Parasuram. This temple first came to the notice of the residents of Kozhikode some 1500 years ago. In addition to being covered in murals, these walls are also covered with paintings that portray scenes from Hindu epics. This temple is well known for its close association with Revathi Pattathanam, an annual seminar between October and November. It is considered one of the most well-known temples in the whole city of Kozhikode. 4. Kotagiri Kotagiri, gifted with a spectacular collection of gorgeous views, is an additional option that is less crowded but pleasurable than the ever-popular Ooty. When you pay a visit to the hill station, take in the breathtaking views, and relax in the pleasant climate, it becomes obvious why the British settled here and made it their summer destination. In addition, Kotagiri is home to several of the region's most popular hiking trails, such as the Kotagiri-Kodanad Trail and the Catherine Falls Trail. These trails are well known in the local hiking community. Kotagiri is the third biggest hill station in the Nilgiris. It is also the location of several significant Hindu temples, such as the Elk Hill Murugan Temple and the temple of the Kamatarya God. 5. Munnar Munnar is renowned for its enormous tea gardens, some of which date back to colonial times. This gorgeous town offers tourists the ideal combination of old-world charms and breathtaking natural scenery. It is easy to understand why Munnar has been Kerala's most popular hill station for as many decades as it has been blessed with attractive lakes, stunning panoramas, lush green hills, and a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Munnar offers all of these things and more. The world-famous Neelakurinji flower, which only opens its petals once every twelve years, may be found in the Munnar region, which also contains the Eravikulam National Park. This region is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species. 6. Olichuchattam Waterfall The Olichuchattam waterfall is widely considered to be among the most magnificent waterfalls not just in Kozhikode but also in all of Kerala. After visiting the waterfall, you can take a breathtaking view of the surrounding region because it is situated at around 6400 feet above mean sea level. However, climbing to the top of the waterfall is a very difficult one. The gigantic obstacle the travellers meet makes it impossible for even the most dedicated trekkers to continue their journey. The highest point of the mountain is called Vellarimala. Although the height of the waterfall is fairly impressive, the amount of water and the flow rate is not quite as strong. The monsoon is the finest time to go to the waterfall since the volume of water would be high enough to offer you a great view of the falls. The waterfall is best visited during the monsoon. In any other case, you will be able to see a stream with a very slow flow. You may walk the remaining six kilometres to reach the peak of the hill if you are an individual who enjoys going on hikes. The journey often starts at the beautiful Muthappanpuzha village, which is very close to the Thiruvambady region of the Kozhikode district. If you are going to the waterfalls with your family, you should not go for the hike since it will be highly inconvenient for everyone in your group. 7. Kozhikode Beach One of the most popular destinations in Calicut/Kozhikode is Kozhikode Beach, often known as Calicut Beach. This beach can be found on the Malabar coast of India. Watching the breathtaking sunset at this stunning beach is a popular activity for out-of-town visitors and residents. Take a leisurely walk down the beach, or kick back and watch the sun sink slowly into the water on the horizon. Early morning is the best time to visit this location if one is interested in testing their chances of seeing dolphins. The months of October through March are perfect for a trip to the beach. 8. Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa Kovalam The Taj Green Cove Resort & Spa in Kovalam is one of the most magnificent resorts around Kozhikode. It is situated on a small hill and offers a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea. This is a huge resort that encompasses a total of 16 acres of land. You will be able to observe some breathtaking scenery when you are here. This resort will provide you with luxury and comfort, and it was designed and furnished in a way that will give you the impression that you are more closely connected to the natural world. 9. Aripara Waterfall Aripara waterfall is a waterfall in the district of Kozhikode that both locals and visitors like to see. It is close to the Thushagiri falls, and in the winter and monsoon seasons, there are many people there. People come to the fall from around the world to see the beautiful waterfall. It is one of the best places in the Kozhikode district to picnic with your family, so don't forget to do that if you go there, but remember to be careful because many people have died attempting to trek around the falls. Near the waterfall, the ground is very slippery, so you should be careful when walking there. Below the waterfall, a pool forms, and many tourists go there to swim in the pool. The pool's cool water will be just what you need to get away from the heat of Kerala. Next TopicTourist Places in Nepal ? prev next ?

Kozhikode is one of Kerala's many beautiful cities, and visiting there is like living out a traveller's dream. Kozhikode is a natural paradise characterized by its abundance of beautiful vegetation, calm beaches, and ancient forts. Going to experience these fantastic sites to visit in Kozhikode, particularly those visitors who are coming here for the first time. They also serve as the ideal weekend getaway. 1. Coonoor In recent years, Coonoor has seen significant growth in terms of its level of popularity. The hill station has all of the amenities available in Ooty; it is located near Ooty yet is still largely unexplored by the crowds of visitors who visit it. In other words, Coonoor is the place to go if you are searching for a mountain range that does not have many people visiting it simultaneously. The hill station is especially renowned for the highly pleasant 9-kilometre climb to Lamb's Rock, which draws in hundreds of hikers on the weekends. The trip is known as the "Lamb's Rock Loop." Coonoor, located in the Nilgiris Range, is a location that UNESCO designated as a World Heritage Site. Coonoor is known to be home to an astounding range of avian species, which may spark the curiosity of the bird-watcher inside you. In addition, it is home to hiking trails, lakes, and a waterfall. 2. Thusharagiri Waterfall The Thusharagiri Waterfall is located in the Kozhikode district of Kerala and is considered one of the region's most important waterfalls. To get to the highest point of the waterfall, you will have to put up with some unpleasant physical conditions. There are five distinct portions of the falls. To get to the tallest falls, you will have to walk for about five kilometres through thick woods (the path isn't exactly in the best condition). If you make it there, though, you will be awestruck by the region's natural splendour. You won't only have a bird's-eye view of the city from this vantage point; you'll also be able to watch the water cascade down from a considerable height. However, you are recommended not to go to the highest point. The lower tiers of the waterfall are the ones most often explored by visitors who are not very physically fit. The nicest thing about the forest is that it is completely covered with trees that grow various herbs and spices, some of which may even be used for therapeutic purposes. You will be completely captivated by the whole region. If you have a passion for animals and the natural world, you could have the opportunity to see some birds or other wildlife creatures that are extinct or very uncommon. If you want to go on nature walks out there, you need to hire a local guide who will be able to assist you in safely finishing the excursion so that you can enjoy the experience. 3.
