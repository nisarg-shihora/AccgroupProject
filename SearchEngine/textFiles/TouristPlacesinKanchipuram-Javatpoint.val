The devotees can be seen lighting diyas (lamps) of ghee, performing Tulsi Archana, and offering festoons and flowers as a token of their love and reverence for Lord Perumal. The temple air is filled with serenity and divinity. Tourists come here in large crowds to seek the blessings of the Lord, particularly on Vaikunta Ekadasi.

Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage.

Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage.

There are 51 of these in India, and Kamakshi Amman temple is one of them. This is where it is believed that the naval portion of her body fell, making it a pious place. Shaktism was founded on a Hindu tradition that worshipped the Goddess. The name Kamakshi literally means 'One with Loving Eyes'.

Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage. It is also called the 'The City of Thousand Temples' because of the various temples situated here. These temples are famous for their huge towers and intricate designs.

Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage.

According to legend, it may have been a part of the Dravida Kingdom. Kalidasa, too, reported it as 'The Best among Cities.' Later on, it was ruled by the Cholas, Pallavas, later Cholas, the Vijayanagara Empire, and even the Britishers, who called it 'Conjeevaram.' Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage. It is also called the 'The City of Thousand Temples' because of the various temples situated here. These temples are famous for their huge towers and intricate designs. The hand-woven silk sarees of Kanchipuram are famous worldwide, so a major workforce is directed towards this task. The place is of interest to not just tourists who are Indian nationals but also foreigners. Kanchipuram is one of the most important places in South India.

Parvati is a Hindu goddess, an embodiment of love and fertility. A Shakti Peeth is a sacred shrine built in places with fallen body parts of Goddess Sati. There are 51 of these in India, and Kamakshi Amman temple is one of them. This is where it is believed that the naval portion of her body fell, making it a pious place. Shaktism was founded on a Hindu tradition that worshipped the Goddess. The name Kamakshi literally means 'One with Loving Eyes'. The syllables' Ka' symbolize Goddess Saraswati, 'Ma' is referred to Goddess Lakshmi and 'Sakshi' is representative of Goddess Parvati.

Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage. It is also called the 'The City of Thousand Temples' because of the various temples situated here. These temples are famous for their huge towers and intricate designs.

Historically, Kanchipuram was considered the hub of education and an important religious center. It happens to be an important site for Hindu pilgrimage.
