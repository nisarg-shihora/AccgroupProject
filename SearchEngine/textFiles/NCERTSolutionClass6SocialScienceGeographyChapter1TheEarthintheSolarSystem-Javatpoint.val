(d) Why the Earth is called a unique planet? Answer: Earth is called a unique planet because, It is the only planet in the solar system that supports life. It has life supporting conditions like oxygen, air, and water. The temperature is neither too hot nor too cold. It is also known as the blue planet because its two-third surface area is covered by water. (e) Why do we see only one side of the moon always? Answer: The time taken by the moon to spin on its axis is the same as the time it takes to orbit the Earth. Hence, we can see only one side of the moon. (f) What is the universe?

(a) The planet known as the "Earth's twin" is: Jupiter Saturn Venus Answer: (iii) Venus Explanation: Venus is known as the Earth's twin because its size and shape is similar to the Earth. (b) Which is the third nearest planet to the sun? Venus Earth Mercury Answer: (ii) Earth Explanation: The Earth is the third nearest planet to the sun. (c) All the planets move around the sun in a Circular path Rectangular path Elongated path Answer: (iii) Elongated path Explanation: All the planets move around the sun in an elongated path known as orbits. (d) The pole star indicates the direction to the South North East Answer: (ii) North Explanation: The pole star in the sky indicates the north direction. Fill in the Blanks. A group of stars forming various patterns is called a constellation. A huge system of stars is called galaxy. Moon is the closest celestial body to our Earth.
