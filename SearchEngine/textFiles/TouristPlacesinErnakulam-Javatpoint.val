There is no place in India where massive trading hubs can coexist with 400-year-old synagogues, historic mosques, Portuguese homes, and the deteriorating remains of the corporate empire. Aside from these, Ernakulam's most popular tourist attractions are the Keralan art exhibitions. Did you know that a bag of Indian pepper was formerly considered fit for human life? Spices were traded by traders in Kerala for precious stones and money centuries ago. The thriving spice trade established India, mainly the Malabar Coast. At that time, Ernakulam was the hub of a well-traveled spice route that drew well-known explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvarez Cabral. The art, architecture, food, and communities of Ernakulam today reflect the influence of several cultures, including Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, French, and English. Let's look at the tourist attractions in Ernakulam that will allow you to experience its history. 1. Vallarpadam Church One of Ernakulam's top tourist destinations is the Vallarpadam Church.

A significant flood destroyed the church in 1676, but the Portuguese built and placed a statue of the Virgin Mary within that same year. The 13th Pope designated this church as a unique church in 1884, making it a popular destination for Christian leaders. A major feast is conducted here every year on 24th September in which people from various countries besides India come and obtain the graces of Mother Mary. The locals here believe that Mother Mary protects them from natural disasters. 2. The Museum of Mattancherry The quaint and traditional suburb of Mattancherry will undoubtedly lure you if you take a stroll through Fort Kochi's streets.

The location now exhibits historic structures and other social and cultural legacies brought by visitors.

There is no place in India where massive trading hubs can coexist with 400-year-old synagogues, historic mosques, Portuguese homes, and the deteriorating remains of the corporate empire. Aside from these, Ernakulam's most popular tourist attractions are the Keralan art exhibitions. Did you know that a bag of Indian pepper was formerly considered fit for human life? Spices were traded by traders in Kerala for precious stones and money centuries ago. The thriving spice trade established India, mainly the Malabar Coast. At that time, Ernakulam was the hub of a well-traveled spice route that drew well-known explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvarez Cabral. The art, architecture, food, and communities of Ernakulam today reflect the influence of several cultures, including Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, French, and English. Let's look at the tourist attractions in Ernakulam that will allow you to experience its history. 1. Vallarpadam Church One of Ernakulam's top tourist destinations is the Vallarpadam Church.

A significant flood destroyed the church in 1676, but the Portuguese built and placed a statue of the Virgin Mary within that same year. The 13th Pope designated this church as a unique church in 1884, making it a popular destination for Christian leaders. A major feast is conducted here every year on 24th September in which people from various countries besides India come and obtain the graces of Mother Mary. The locals here believe that Mother Mary protects them from natural disasters. 2. The Museum of Mattancherry The quaint and traditional suburb of Mattancherry will undoubtedly lure you if you take a stroll through Fort Kochi's streets.

The location now exhibits historic structures and other social and cultural legacies brought by visitors.

There is no place in India where massive trading hubs can coexist with 400-year-old synagogues, historic mosques, Portuguese homes, and the deteriorating remains of the corporate empire. Aside from these, Ernakulam's most popular tourist attractions are the Keralan art exhibitions. Did you know that a bag of Indian pepper was formerly considered fit for human life? Spices were traded by traders in Kerala for precious stones and money centuries ago. The thriving spice trade established India, mainly the Malabar Coast. At that time, Ernakulam was the hub of a well-traveled spice route that drew well-known explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvarez Cabral. The art, architecture, food, and communities of Ernakulam today reflect the influence of several cultures, including Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, French, and English.

The 13th Pope designated this church as a unique church in 1884, making it a popular destination for Christian leaders.

There is no place in India where massive trading hubs can coexist with 400-year-old synagogues, historic mosques, Portuguese homes, and the deteriorating remains of the corporate empire. Aside from these, Ernakulam's most popular tourist attractions are the Keralan art exhibitions. Did you know that a bag of Indian pepper was formerly considered fit for human life? Spices were traded by traders in Kerala for precious stones and money centuries ago. The thriving spice trade established India, mainly the Malabar Coast. At that time, Ernakulam was the hub of a well-traveled spice route that drew well-known explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvarez Cabral. The art, architecture, food, and communities of Ernakulam today reflect the influence of several cultures, including Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, French, and English. Let's look at the tourist attractions in Ernakulam that will allow you to experience its history. 1. Vallarpadam Church One of Ernakulam's top tourist destinations is the Vallarpadam Church.

A significant flood destroyed the church in 1676, but the Portuguese built and placed a statue of the Virgin Mary within that same year. The 13th Pope designated this church as a unique church in 1884, making it a popular destination for Christian leaders. A major feast is conducted here every year on 24th September in which people from various countries besides India come and obtain the graces of Mother Mary. The locals here believe that Mother Mary protects them from natural disasters. 2. The Museum of Mattancherry The quaint and traditional suburb of Mattancherry will undoubtedly lure you if you take a stroll through Fort Kochi's streets.

The location now exhibits historic structures and other social and cultural legacies brought by visitors.

There is no place in India where massive trading hubs can coexist with 400-year-old synagogues, historic mosques, Portuguese homes, and the deteriorating remains of the corporate empire. Aside from these, Ernakulam's most popular tourist attractions are the Keralan art exhibitions. Did you know that a bag of Indian pepper was formerly considered fit for human life? Spices were traded by traders in Kerala for precious stones and money centuries ago. The thriving spice trade established India, mainly the Malabar Coast. At that time, Ernakulam was the hub of a well-traveled spice route that drew well-known explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvarez Cabral. The art, architecture, food, and communities of Ernakulam today reflect the influence of several cultures, including Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, French, and English.

The 13th Pope designated this church as a unique church in 1884, making it a popular destination for Christian leaders.

There is no place in India where massive trading hubs can coexist with 400-year-old synagogues, historic mosques, Portuguese homes, and the deteriorating remains of the corporate empire. Aside from these, Ernakulam's most popular tourist attractions are the Keralan art exhibitions. Did you know that a bag of Indian pepper was formerly considered fit for human life? Spices were traded by traders in Kerala for precious stones and money centuries ago. The thriving spice trade established India, mainly the Malabar Coast. At that time, Ernakulam was the hub of a well-traveled spice route that drew well-known explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvarez Cabral. The art, architecture, food, and communities of Ernakulam today reflect the influence of several cultures, including Persian, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, French, and English. Let's look at the tourist attractions in Ernakulam that will allow you to experience its history. 1. Vallarpadam Church One of Ernakulam's top tourist destinations is the Vallarpadam Church.

A significant flood destroyed the church in 1676, but the Portuguese built and placed a statue of the Virgin Mary within that same year. The 13th Pope designated this church as a unique church in 1884, making it a popular destination for Christian leaders. A major feast is conducted here every year on 24th September in which people from various countries besides India come and obtain the graces of Mother Mary. The locals here believe that Mother Mary protects them from natural disasters. 2. The Museum of Mattancherry The quaint and traditional suburb of Mattancherry will undoubtedly lure you if you take a stroll through Fort Kochi's streets.

The location now exhibits historic structures and other social and cultural legacies brought by visitors.
