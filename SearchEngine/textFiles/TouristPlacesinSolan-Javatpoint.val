The majority of tourists choose Solan because it is less crowded, charming, and has lovely hills. Solan is quickly becoming a popular tourist destination. In and around Solan, there are numerous interesting locations. Consequently, this is the list of some of Solan's tourist destinations. 1. Dagshai The rocky Solan district of Himachal Pradesh in India's Dagshai or Daag-e-shahi is home to the country's oldest cantonment town. This tiny village, perched on top of a hill 5,689 feet above sea level, is definitely worth a visit at least once in a lifetime to see what a true offbeat attraction is like. The East India Company established the township's foundation in 1847. This episode took place after Bhupinder Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala, had given the East India Company control over selected villages of Badhtiala, Chunawad, Dabbi, Jawag, and Dagshai. The town has a prison as well, where the Irish soldiers who mutinied in 1920 were housed. Numerous structures from the British era may be found in the hill station, which serves as an army cantonment area. An army unit is stationed in the town, along with a residential Army Public School and a private school called Dagshai Public School. The two schools take up the majority of the hilltop because the town is so small. However, the town has some fascinating sites that make the trip both entertaining and educational, like the church and the Dagshai cells jail. Despite being small, the town is able to provide tourists with several noteworthy and lovely sites, like the Old European Cemetery. Despite the area's rough terrain's geographical characteristics, a sizable playfield can still be found there. A short while ago, Durand Cup games were played on this pitch. One of the main tourist attractions in this area is the church of Dagshai, which is renowned for its colonial architecture.

For a more rewarding experience, you might even stay at one of the resorts. Only 45 kilometers separate Chail from Solan, another significant nearby city. The former Maharaja of Patiala constructed Chail, the city that served as Patiala's summer capital, when he was exiled from Shimla (he eloped with the daughter of then commander-in-chief of the British Army, Lord Kitchener). Chail has drawn travelers looking for a vacation surrounded by the splendor of the Shivalik hills ever since it was founded in 1893.

Dagshai The rocky Solan district of Himachal Pradesh in India's Dagshai or Daag-e-shahi is home to the country's oldest cantonment town.

This episode took place after Bhupinder Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala, had given the East India Company control over selected villages of Badhtiala, Chunawad, Dabbi, Jawag, and Dagshai. The town has a prison as well, where the Irish soldiers who mutinied in 1920 were housed. Numerous structures from the British era may be found in the hill station, which serves as an army cantonment area. An army unit is stationed in the town, along with a residential Army Public School and a private school called Dagshai Public School. The two schools take up the majority of the hilltop because the town is so small. However, the town has some fascinating sites that make the trip both entertaining and educational, like the church and the Dagshai cells jail.

The distance from it to Shimla, the state capital, is 45.5 kilometers. The average elevation in Solan is 1,284 meters. On the Kalka-Shimla National Highway-5, the city is approximately halfway between Chandigarh and Shimla. The majority of tourists choose Solan because it is less crowded, charming, and has lovely hills. Solan is quickly becoming a popular tourist destination. In and around Solan, there are numerous interesting locations. Consequently, this is the list of some of Solan's tourist destinations. 1. Dagshai The rocky Solan district of Himachal Pradesh in India's Dagshai or Daag-e-shahi is home to the country's oldest cantonment town. This tiny village, perched on top of a hill 5,689 feet above sea level, is definitely worth a visit at least once in a lifetime to see what a true offbeat attraction is like. The East India Company established the township's foundation in 1847. This episode took place after Bhupinder Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala, had given the East India Company control over selected villages of Badhtiala, Chunawad, Dabbi, Jawag, and Dagshai. The town has a prison as well, where the Irish soldiers who mutinied in 1920 were housed. Numerous structures from the British era may be found in the hill station, which serves as an army cantonment area. An army unit is stationed in the town, along with a residential Army Public School and a private school called Dagshai Public School. The two schools take up the majority of the hilltop because the town is so small. However, the town has some fascinating sites that make the trip both entertaining and educational, like the church and the Dagshai cells jail. Despite being small, the town is able to provide tourists with several noteworthy and lovely sites, like the Old European Cemetery. Despite the area's rough terrain's geographical characteristics, a sizable playfield can still be found there. A short while ago, Durand Cup games were played on this pitch. One of the main tourist attractions in this area is the church of Dagshai, which is renowned for its colonial architecture. With its amazing characteristics and stunning beauty, the church doesn't ever fail to impress visitors. Although there are no hotels in Dagshai, there are many places to go on a picnic with friends and family. A view of Chandigarh and Panchkula's whole nighttime illuminations is possible from a few of these locations. A sizable field for playing is also available for the tourists nearby. 2. Chail Chail is a peaceful hill town just 4 kilometers from Shimla. The highest cricket pitch is also located in Chail. It is also home to the Chail Palace, a historic hotel.

For a more rewarding experience, you might even stay at one of the resorts. Only 45 kilometers separate Chail from Solan, another significant nearby city. The former Maharaja of Patiala constructed Chail, the city that served as Patiala's summer capital, when he was exiled from Shimla (he eloped with the daughter of then commander-in-chief of the British Army, Lord Kitchener). Chail has drawn travelers looking for a vacation surrounded by the splendor of the Shivalik hills ever since it was founded in 1893.

The distance from it to Shimla, the state capital, is 45.5 kilometers. The average elevation in Solan is 1,284 meters. On the Kalka-Shimla National Highway-5, the city is approximately halfway between Chandigarh and Shimla. The majority of tourists choose Solan because it is less crowded, charming, and has lovely hills. Solan is quickly becoming a popular tourist destination. In and around Solan, there are numerous interesting locations. Consequently, this is the list of some of Solan's tourist destinations. 1. Dagshai The rocky Solan district of Himachal Pradesh in India's Dagshai or Daag-e-shahi is home to the country's oldest cantonment town. This tiny village, perched on top of a hill 5,689 feet above sea level, is definitely worth a visit at least once in a lifetime to see what a true offbeat attraction is like. The East India Company established the township's foundation in 1847. This episode took place after Bhupinder Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala, had given the East India Company control over selected villages of Badhtiala, Chunawad, Dabbi, Jawag, and Dagshai. The town has a prison as well, where the Irish soldiers who mutinied in 1920 were housed. Numerous structures from the British era may be found in the hill station, which serves as an army cantonment area. An army unit is stationed in the town, along with a residential Army Public School and a private school called Dagshai Public School. The two schools take up the majority of the hilltop because the town is so small. However, the town has some fascinating sites that make the trip both entertaining and educational, like the church and the Dagshai cells jail. Despite being small, the town is able to provide tourists with several noteworthy and lovely sites, like the Old European Cemetery. Despite the area's rough terrain's geographical characteristics, a sizable playfield can still be found there. A short while ago, Durand Cup games were played on this pitch. One of the main tourist attractions in this area is the church of Dagshai, which is renowned for its colonial architecture. With its amazing characteristics and stunning beauty, the church doesn't ever fail to impress visitors. Although there are no hotels in Dagshai, there are many places to go on a picnic with friends and family. A view of Chandigarh and Panchkula's whole nighttime illuminations is possible from a few of these locations. A sizable field for playing is also available for the tourists nearby. 2. Chail Chail is a peaceful hill town just 4 kilometers from Shimla. The highest cricket pitch is also located in Chail. It is also home to the Chail Palace, a historic hotel. Chail is a city in India that is 2,250 meters above sea level and encircled by pines and deodar trees.

For a more rewarding experience, you might even stay at one of the resorts. Only 45 kilometers separate Chail from Solan, another significant nearby city. The former Maharaja of Patiala constructed Chail, the city that served as Patiala's summer capital, when he was exiled from Shimla (he eloped with the daughter of then commander-in-chief of the British Army, Lord Kitchener). Chail has drawn travelers looking for a vacation surrounded by the splendor of the Shivalik hills ever since it was founded in 1893.
