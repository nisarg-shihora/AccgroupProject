Neo4j is best for storing data that has many interconnecting relationships that's why graph databases like Neo4j has an advantage and much better at dealing with relational data than relational databases are. The graph model doesn't usually require a predefined schema. So there is no need to create the database structure before you load the data (like you do in a relational database).

They also present data in a tabular fashion. Neo4j doesn't use tables, rows, or columns to store or present data. Neo4j is best for storing data that has many interconnecting relationships that's why graph databases like Neo4j has an advantage and much better at dealing with relational data than relational databases are. The graph model doesn't usually require a predefined schema. So there is no need to create the database structure before you load the data (like you do in a relational database). In Neo4j, the data is the structure. Neo4j is a "schema-optional" DBMS. In Neo4j, no need to set up primary key/foreign key constraints to predetermine which fields can have a relationship, and to which data.

Neo4j is best for storing data that has many interconnecting relationships that's why graph databases like Neo4j has an advantage and much better at dealing with relational data than relational databases are.

Neo4j is best for storing data that has many interconnecting relationships that's why graph databases like Neo4j has an advantage and much better at dealing with relational data than relational databases are.

Neo4j Working Neo4j stores and displays data in the form of graph. In Neo4j, data is represented by nodes and relationships between those nodes. Neo4j databases (as with any graph database) are a lot different to relational databases such as MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL, etc. Relational databases use tables, rows, and columns to store data. They also present data in a tabular fashion. Neo4j doesn't use tables, rows, or columns to store or present data. Neo4j is best for storing data that has many interconnecting relationships that's why graph databases like Neo4j has an advantage and much better at dealing with relational data than relational databases are. The graph model doesn't usually require a predefined schema. So there is no need to create the database structure before you load the data (like you do in a relational database). In Neo4j, the data is the structure. Neo4j is a "schema-optional" DBMS. In Neo4j, no need to set up primary key/foreign key constraints to predetermine which fields can have a relationship, and to which data. You just have to define the relationships between the nodes you need.
