No matter if you want to watch comedy videos or intense news channels, music, or even movies, everything is available on YouTube for free. But are you aware of how many career opportunities are created due to YouTube? Or how many people are earning far more than you or I can think with the help of YouTube? YouTube is loved not only by viewers but also by people who are trying to create a career in entertainment (because it's not as tough as the film industry, after all). Do you wonder about some names? Or are you finding something fun to watch? Or are they just here due to curiosity? So in this article, we are covering some best YouTube channels on the basis of their popularity and number of subscribers so that you can find some inspiration and entertainment in the same place without any pressure. 1. T-series Country- India Language- Hindi, English, and other regional languages Category - Music Subscribers- 217 million The highest subscribed channel in the world is the official YouTube channel of an Indian Music Label brand, "T-Series". This Company created music for almost 5-6 decades and has earned a prestigious identity in the Music world. It was launched in 1983, and many Bollywood movies, as well as Indian Pop music, have been created under this label. This is also one of the major reasons behind the popularity of the channel because Bollywood lovers find many latest songs and trailers of latest and upcoming movies on their YouTube handles. Since 2017, it continues to hold the position of the most viewed channel and not only in Hindi and English, but the people who want to find content in Indian regional languages such as Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi and Rajasthani also visit this channel and get their content. 2. Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes Country- United States Language- English Category - Education Subscribers- 135 Million I know this may surprise you, but the second most subscribed channel on YouTube is Cocomelon which is a channel specially created for educational purposes and has 3D animated videos of long-established children's songs and nursery poems and also a few of their own created videos for children. The channel became famous when it launched its "Bath Song", and within some time, it became one of the most viewed videos on YouTube, with 5 billion views. You may think, what makes a nursery rhymes channel so popular and is it even good for children or not? Well, we can't explain, but for sure the number of 135 Million subscribers shows that they are loved by the children and their parents all over the world more than we can think. 3. Set India Country- India Language- Hindi Category - entertainment Subscribers- 133 Million Another Indian entertainment brand Set India is the third most subscribed on YouTube. Talking about its foundation, it is the entertainment segment of a popular Japanese electronics firm, "Sony", and the full form for "SET India" is Sony Entertainment Television India, which is also an entertainment channel on Indian Television, featuring various reality shows and daily dramas. The fans of these dramas and especially shows like Indian Idol and India Got talent love to watch videos of their favourite shows on their YouTube channel, and this may be the reason behind the growth and success of these channels. 4. PewDiePie Country- Sweden Language- English Category - Gaming Subscribers- 111 Million You may not be aware of the name Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, but it is impossible for someone who plays games or even watches gaming videos on YouTube to be unaware of the name of PewdiePie. He is one of the best gamers (probably the best) globally and also an inspiration for millions. He started his career as just a small YouTuber, but within a very small period, his amazing attitude and gameplay made him a star for many. He was also featured in TIME magazine's "100 most influential" list and also in the episodes of South Park. With the huge numbers of views on his channel content (approximately 28 billion), he is the most successful gamer and content creator on YouTube, and with time people's love for his games and his channel is just increasing day by day. 5. Mr Beast Country- United States Language- English Category - Entertainment Subscribers- 96.4 Million Followed by many, Jimmy Donaldson, or more popular with his YouTube name Mr Beast, is an admired content creator and YouTuber who is getting more and more success from his different stunts. His first popular viral video, "counting to 100,000," was created in 2017. And after that, he kept on doing more and more different activities for his YouTube subscribers, especially when he tried to recreate the set of the popular Netflix series Squid Game and carry out more than 456 people to contend for 456,000 US dollars prize money. Jimmy Donaldson is also the most earning YouTuber with a net worth of 54 million US Dollars (according to Forbes Magazine in 2021). 6. Kids Diana Show Country- Ukraine Language- English Category - Film Subscribers- 95.2 Million Again another channel loved by Kids, Ukraine's Kids Diana Show is much like a blog channel of a 7-year-old young girl Diana and also features her brother Roma (who owns another channel with his name Kids Roma Show). This channel is completely focused on this young girl and kids of her age, and the channel consists of videos where both siblings play and do further kids' stuff together. The growth of the channel keeps on going, and kids not only in Ukraine but from the entire world enjoy it. This is why the videos are being dubbed in several languages such as Hindi, German, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, and Japanese. 7. Like Nastya Country- Russia Language- English Category - entertainment Subscribers- 94.3 Million This 8-year-old little girl earns more than even you ever dreamt of. Nastya is a YouTube channel of Anastasia Radzinskaya, who is just a little girl but has the attention of the whole world due to her cuteness. In the starting, her not-so-rich parents created videos from their family saving accounts and created videos of unboxing toys, visiting parks, and even playing with Anastasia. Still, now her channel earned a massive amount and even helped Nastya and her parents to switch their place from Russia to Florida. I don't know if you agree with me or not but having 94.3 million subscribers is not possible for someone with even an average fortune. 8. WWE Country- United States Language- English Category - sports Subscribers- 88.3 Million No doubt you are completely aware of what WWE is if you were a kid growing up in the 20s era, and this is why you must be not surprised to know that the official youtube channel of World Wrestling Entertainment is one of the 10 most-subscribed YouTube channels worldwide. WWE has a separate fan base with kids of various age groups, and also, the youth has grown in this era. The channel posts the video of highlights of the matches, interviews of popular wrestling stars, and elite content with the era's leading superstars, and this is why the fans of wrestling all around the world are on the channel to make it one of the best channels in the YouTube and also most popular sports entertainment channel. 9. Zee Music Company Country- India Language- English, Hindi, Punjabi, etc Category - Music Subscribers- 84 Million No doubt, Indian music has its own fan base all around the world, and maybe this is why one more Indian Music Channel keeps its place in the Top 10 list on YouTube. ZEE music Company is mainly based in Mumbai, India, and is the main opponent firm of T-Series or Sony music which is also in the top 3 YouTube's most-subscribed pages. The firm is working as a brand for Indian music, and this is why the channel features the top hit songs from various artists and songs from Bollywood songs. 10. Vlad and Nick Country- Russia Language- English Category - entertainment Subscribers- 81.8 Million This is the 10th most subscribed channel on YouTube, and surprisingly, it is also a kid channel and very popular for the cute little kids Vlad and Niki.

Today the channel has nearly 76.6 million subscribers and features videos with various life hacks. Still, the channel earns more fame from the critics than the users as they don't support the channel's life hacks (call them dangerous) and also give all the credit for the existence of the channel to clickbait. No matter what they call it, there is a huge fan following as well as hate toward the life hacks, short tricks and how to format videos of the channel and people keep on visiting it at a vast number. Many YouTubers even create roast videos on the videos of hacks of 5-Minute Craft, whereas many keep on trying them, but in the end, lots of them get their content from it.
