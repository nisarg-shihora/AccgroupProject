Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J.

What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain.

So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

The series seems simple and so perfect for small-town life. But the twists come when two missing kids reach this full of mystery community.

Overall this series is full of events like missing children, supernatural creatures, and even time travelling but not like any other series but in a new and perfect manner, which makes it worth watching for sure. 8.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3. The Haunting of the Hill House or The Haunting of Bly Manor Stars -Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth Reaser, Annabeth Gish, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti Number of episodes- 10 Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.7 out of 10 Created by Mike Flanagan The main reason behind creating this story was not only to create a horror tv series, but it was also created to make people aware of the classic novel of great writer Shirley Jackson. The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4.

These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J.

The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3. The Haunting of the Hill House or The Haunting of Bly Manor Stars -Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth Reaser, Annabeth Gish, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti Number of episodes- 10 Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.7 out of 10 Created by Mike Flanagan The main reason behind creating this story was not only to create a horror tv series, but it was also created to make people aware of the classic novel of great writer Shirley Jackson. The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

The series seems simple and so perfect for small-town life. But the twists come when two missing kids reach this full of mystery community. This is so weird and different but awesome web series that you probably won't get anything like it soon. Overall this series is full of events like missing children, supernatural creatures, and even time travelling but not like any other series but in a new and perfect manner, which makes it worth watching for sure. 8.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3. The Haunting of the Hill House or The Haunting of Bly Manor Stars -Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth Reaser, Annabeth Gish, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti Number of episodes- 10 Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.7 out of 10 Created by Mike Flanagan The main reason behind creating this story was not only to create a horror tv series, but it was also created to make people aware of the classic novel of great writer Shirley Jackson. The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4.

These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J.

The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3. The Haunting of the Hill House or The Haunting of Bly Manor Stars -Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth Reaser, Annabeth Gish, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti Number of episodes- 10 Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.7 out of 10 Created by Mike Flanagan The main reason behind creating this story was not only to create a horror tv series, but it was also created to make people aware of the classic novel of great writer Shirley Jackson. The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

The series seems simple and so perfect for small-town life. But the twists come when two missing kids reach this full of mystery community. This is so weird and different but awesome web series that you probably won't get anything like it soon. Overall this series is full of events like missing children, supernatural creatures, and even time travelling but not like any other series but in a new and perfect manner, which makes it worth watching for sure. 8.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3. The Haunting of the Hill House or The Haunting of Bly Manor Stars -Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth Reaser, Annabeth Gish, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti Number of episodes- 10 Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.7 out of 10 Created by Mike Flanagan The main reason behind creating this story was not only to create a horror tv series, but it was also created to make people aware of the classic novel of great writer Shirley Jackson. The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

Whether it's a sleepless night or a weekend, Netflix and chill are compulsory for youth these days (though there are always exceptions). These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3.

The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4.

These days Netflix also creates its own original web series, plus the most recent releases are also available on the channel, and this is making old dish connections way outdated these days. But the variety it offers also makes it hard for people to find what to watch and what is worth watching. To make this hard situation easy, here is a list of some best series you can binge-watch on Netflix right away. We are not saying that any series is better than others; these all are best according to the ratings and views. 1. Narcos Stars - Pedro Pascal, Wagner Moura, Boyd Holbrook Number of episodes- 30 episodes Length of episodes- 49 minutes (average) Genre - Biography, Crime, Drama IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro This awesome American crime web series is not only a masterpiece of its cinematography, but also the star cast has shown their talent much more than any normal series. The series played a phenomenal role in showing how a young man who dreams a lot and has a smart mind and intelligence achieves the height any common person can't even think of. The story of the series shows the success and the downfall of the popular drug mafia Pablo Escobar, who belongs to Columbia. In the series, Columbia is shown as a very dangerous country full of crimes and criminals all around. The series shows two agents, Murphy and Pena, who are honestly just watching all this and doing nothing until they meet Pablo, who is full of resources. So overall this series is fun to watch and full of twists and turns, whereas the use of a few Spanish words (which you probably don't understand until you can speak Spanish) can make you curious a little. Still, overall, this is a must-watch for everyone (also who know the real story of Pablo can enjoy the series) and find out the surprises which are waiting for you in the series. 2. Stranger Things Stars - Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, David Harbour Number of episodes- 25 Number of the season- 4 (till now) Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer (Duffer brothers) One of the best series for those who love to binge-watch extreme drama and supernatural horror shows. The Duffer Brothers are super talented, no doubt, but after watching this series, you are going to call them masters of creating series. Talking about the story of the first season, the series is about a young boy Will Byers who suddenly disappears, and his mother, Joyce, and the Sheriff (police inspector) try to help and find Will. Somehow when they find Will, the story takes a turn to weird supernatural things that Will, his mother, his friends, and the sheriff tries to get rid of. It is one of the best dramas of supernatural and science fiction but also is one of the best horror shows you'll ever get to watch. The series shows many monsters which make you shiver many times, and the amazing acting skills of the caste will make you fall in love with the characters and feel their pain as well, especially the character of Mille Bobby Brown as eleven when she tries to find her friend it makes everyone so emotional and disheartened. If you are planning to watch this series alone at night, we will recommend you to have someone by your side, and if you want to watch a series that can make your brain think more and more than this is perfect for you to start, but if you don't like horror series than you can skip the idea of watching it. 3. The Haunting of the Hill House or The Haunting of Bly Manor Stars -Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth Reaser, Annabeth Gish, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Kate Siegel, Victoria Pedretti Number of episodes- 10 Genre - Drama, Fantasy, Horror IM.D Ratings- 8.7 out of 10 Created by Mike Flanagan The main reason behind creating this story was not only to create a horror tv series, but it was also created to make people aware of the classic novel of great writer Shirley Jackson. The way it shows the monsters, ghosts, and other scary things giving you a jump scare, a person with a weak heart should avoid watching it. The way director planned to scare you is completely successful, and you'll feel uneasiness after watching the series, and you'll feel tricked from time to time at various stages. So if you are someone who loves to watch for thrilling experiences and a complete haunted experience, then you should watch The Haunting of Hill House. The series shows how the people who completely left their childhood behind have to return back to the place where they started, and this gives the series a twist of drama and thrill, which makes you feel stunned and surprised at the end. Overall it is a complete mixture of surprises, romance, horror, and thrill, which can not be compared with other horror series showing the battle between good and bad. This story makes you feel connected even if the ghost seems like a creature of pity and pain, and this is why it wins over your emotions and makes you watch it till the end. 4. The Umbrella Academy Stars - Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, and Kate Walsh. Number of episodes- 20 Number of the season- 3 Length of episodes- 48 minutes Genre - Drama, Action, Dark Comedy, Science fantasy, fiction IM.D Ratings- 8 out of 10 Created by Steve Blackman If you are someone who enjoys watching superhero web series, this one is the perfect one. In the first season, you'll find a series that is very different from typical superhero shows and make you feel sad for the characters who don't want to live up to the life they live on. The series runs around seven Hargreaves children who are working in the supernatural team, but these superheroes are not so fortunate to get the powers that they never want. What do they get at the end? So many mental issues, weird addictions, and a lot of loneliness and pain. Yet it is a completely perfect story with so many perfect twists and turns, and also fun to watch how all these kids help each other to create a better version of themselves despite the mistakes they make. So overall, this story does not for a second make you feel like it is a comic book, no matter how many twists and turns keep coming, it is not going to make you feel not connected at all, and in the end, this story is all about family, forgiveness, and hope which make it different from other stories. 5. Scared Games Stars -Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Suvreen Chawla Number of episodes- 16 Length of episodes- 51 minutes Genre - Crime, Drama, thrill IM.D Ratings- 8.8 out of 10 Created by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Neeraj Ghaywan If you want to watch the best web series on Netflix India, this is the one, and it is available in both Hindi and English.

It is one of the best series ever created in Bollywood, with awesome acting and direction. Overall, to the people who want to watch something fun in the field of politics, action, and mind games, but if you are someone who doesn't prefer watching such kind of criminal series, you can skip it for now. 6.

The series was originally made in the German language, and the creator had no plan to make a creepy, haunted, and confusing, but the "David Lynch" version makes it specific and different from other shows. The series seems simple and so perfect for small-town life. But the twists come when two missing kids reach this full of mystery community. This is so weird and different but awesome web series that you probably won't get anything like it soon. Overall this series is full of events like missing children, supernatural creatures, and even time travelling but not like any other series but in a new and perfect manner, which makes it worth watching for sure. 8.
