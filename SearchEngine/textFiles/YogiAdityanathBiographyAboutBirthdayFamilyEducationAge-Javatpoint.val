In 1990, while still in college, he joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In 1992, he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics. However, his attempts to find a scientific job in Gorakhpur were unsuccessful because Yogi Adityanath's graduation certificate was stolen while he was staying in Kotdwar. After that, Adityanath applied for a postgraduate programme in a scientific field at an institute in Rishikesh, but due to the ongoing Ayodhya movement, in which he was actively involved, he encountered several difficulties being accepted, which led him to turn his focus to the opposition. EARLY LIFE Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht. He was born on June 5th, 1972, in the Pauri Garhwal hamlet in Uttarakhand. Anand Singh Bisht, his father, worked as a forest ranger. He joined the Ayodhya Ram temple movement and accepted Mahant Avaidyanath as his mentor. After that got the nickname "Yogi Adityanath" and replaced Mahant Avaidyanath, the movement's major figure for the Ram temple at the time. Mahant Avaidyanath named Yogi Adityanath as his heir in 1994, and then he became Gorakhnath Math's head priest. He was selected to lead Gorakhnath Math. At that time, he was responsible for supervising the education system, healthcare centres, and charitable trust of Gorakhnath. Adityanath was moved to the role of Gorakhnath Math Mahant soon after Avaidyantah expired on September 12, 2014. He was named Peethadhishwar (Head Seer) of the Math according to the rituals of Nath sect EARLY POLITICAL CAREER Yogi Adityanath was appointed to Gorakhnath Maths in 1994. After four years, he became MP in the Indian Parliament's Lower House. He was the youngest representative in the 12th Lok Sabha. Five years in a row, Gorakhpur voters chose him to represent him in Parliament. Furthermore, he created Hindu Yuva Vahini, a youth organisation. Hindu Yuva Vahini played a vital role in Yogi Adityanath's rapid rise, leading him to lead his following political victory. Sangh Parivar came together in an Ayodhya movement in 1991, and the same year Avaidyanath joined the Bhartiya Janta Party.

Adityanath's imprisonment created riots in several areas, and Hindu Yuva Vahini members set fire to many coaches on the Mumbai-Gorakhpur Godan Express.

However, his attempts to find a scientific job in Gorakhpur were unsuccessful because Yogi Adityanath's graduation certificate was stolen while he was staying in Kotdwar. After that, Adityanath applied for a postgraduate programme in a scientific field at an institute in Rishikesh, but due to the ongoing Ayodhya movement, in which he was actively involved, he encountered several difficulties being accepted, which led him to turn his focus to the opposition. EARLY LIFE Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht. He was born on June 5th, 1972, in the Pauri Garhwal hamlet in Uttarakhand. Anand Singh Bisht, his father, worked as a forest ranger. He joined the Ayodhya Ram temple movement and accepted Mahant Avaidyanath as his mentor.

In 1990, while still in college, he joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In 1992, he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics. However, his attempts to find a scientific job in Gorakhpur were unsuccessful because Yogi Adityanath's graduation certificate was stolen while he was staying in Kotdwar. After that, Adityanath applied for a postgraduate programme in a scientific field at an institute in Rishikesh, but due to the ongoing Ayodhya movement, in which he was actively involved, he encountered several difficulties being accepted, which led him to turn his focus to the opposition. EARLY LIFE Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht. He was born on June 5th, 1972, in the Pauri Garhwal hamlet in Uttarakhand. Anand Singh Bisht, his father, worked as a forest ranger. He joined the Ayodhya Ram temple movement and accepted Mahant Avaidyanath as his mentor. After that got the nickname "Yogi Adityanath" and replaced Mahant Avaidyanath, the movement's major figure for the Ram temple at the time. Mahant Avaidyanath named Yogi Adityanath as his heir in 1994, and then he became Gorakhnath Math's head priest. He was selected to lead Gorakhnath Math. At that time, he was responsible for supervising the education system, healthcare centres, and charitable trust of Gorakhnath. Adityanath was moved to the role of Gorakhnath Math Mahant soon after Avaidyantah expired on September 12, 2014. He was named Peethadhishwar (Head Seer) of the Math according to the rituals of Nath sect EARLY POLITICAL CAREER Yogi Adityanath was appointed to Gorakhnath Maths in 1994. After four years, he became MP in the Indian Parliament's Lower House. He was the youngest representative in the 12th Lok Sabha. Five years in a row, Gorakhpur voters chose him to represent him in Parliament. Furthermore, he created Hindu Yuva Vahini, a youth organisation. Hindu Yuva Vahini played a vital role in Yogi Adityanath's rapid rise, leading him to lead his following political victory. Sangh Parivar came together in an Ayodhya movement in 1991, and the same year Avaidyanath joined the Bhartiya Janta Party.

Adityanath's imprisonment created riots in several areas, and Hindu Yuva Vahini members set fire to many coaches on the Mumbai-Gorakhpur Godan Express.

However, his attempts to find a scientific job in Gorakhpur were unsuccessful because Yogi Adityanath's graduation certificate was stolen while he was staying in Kotdwar. After that, Adityanath applied for a postgraduate programme in a scientific field at an institute in Rishikesh, but due to the ongoing Ayodhya movement, in which he was actively involved, he encountered several difficulties being accepted, which led him to turn his focus to the opposition. EARLY LIFE Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht. He was born on June 5th, 1972, in the Pauri Garhwal hamlet in Uttarakhand. Anand Singh Bisht, his father, worked as a forest ranger. He joined the Ayodhya Ram temple movement and accepted Mahant Avaidyanath as his mentor.

In 1990, while still in college, he joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In 1992, he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics. However, his attempts to find a scientific job in Gorakhpur were unsuccessful because Yogi Adityanath's graduation certificate was stolen while he was staying in Kotdwar. After that, Adityanath applied for a postgraduate programme in a scientific field at an institute in Rishikesh, but due to the ongoing Ayodhya movement, in which he was actively involved, he encountered several difficulties being accepted, which led him to turn his focus to the opposition. EARLY LIFE Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht. He was born on June 5th, 1972, in the Pauri Garhwal hamlet in Uttarakhand. Anand Singh Bisht, his father, worked as a forest ranger. He joined the Ayodhya Ram temple movement and accepted Mahant Avaidyanath as his mentor. After that got the nickname "Yogi Adityanath" and replaced Mahant Avaidyanath, the movement's major figure for the Ram temple at the time. Mahant Avaidyanath named Yogi Adityanath as his heir in 1994, and then he became Gorakhnath Math's head priest. He was selected to lead Gorakhnath Math. At that time, he was responsible for supervising the education system, healthcare centres, and charitable trust of Gorakhnath. Adityanath was moved to the role of Gorakhnath Math Mahant soon after Avaidyantah expired on September 12, 2014. He was named Peethadhishwar (Head Seer) of the Math according to the rituals of Nath sect EARLY POLITICAL CAREER Yogi Adityanath was appointed to Gorakhnath Maths in 1994. After four years, he became MP in the Indian Parliament's Lower House. He was the youngest representative in the 12th Lok Sabha. Five years in a row, Gorakhpur voters chose him to represent him in Parliament. Furthermore, he created Hindu Yuva Vahini, a youth organisation. Hindu Yuva Vahini played a vital role in Yogi Adityanath's rapid rise, leading him to lead his following political victory. Sangh Parivar came together in an Ayodhya movement in 1991, and the same year Avaidyanath joined the Bhartiya Janta Party.

Adityanath's imprisonment created riots in several areas, and Hindu Yuva Vahini members set fire to many coaches on the Mumbai-Gorakhpur Godan Express.

However, his attempts to find a scientific job in Gorakhpur were unsuccessful because Yogi Adityanath's graduation certificate was stolen while he was staying in Kotdwar. After that, Adityanath applied for a postgraduate programme in a scientific field at an institute in Rishikesh, but due to the ongoing Ayodhya movement, in which he was actively involved, he encountered several difficulties being accepted, which led him to turn his focus to the opposition. EARLY LIFE Yogi Adityanath's real name is Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht. He was born on June 5th, 1972, in the Pauri Garhwal hamlet in Uttarakhand. Anand Singh Bisht, his father, worked as a forest ranger. He joined the Ayodhya Ram temple movement and accepted Mahant Avaidyanath as his mentor.
