Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ;

	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ;

	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

	printf ( "  % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
}
 Output: Enter Base: 5
Enter Power: 3
5 ^ 3 = 125

 Explanation The code above has an O (N) time complexity, where N is the exponent. O is the space complexity (1). Using While loop: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int main ( )
{
    int n , exp , exp1 ;
    long long int value = 1 ; 
    printf ( " enter the number and its exponential : \ n \ n " ) ;
    scanf ( " % d % d " , & n , & exp ) ; 
    exp1 = exp ;   // storing original value for future use
    // same as while ( ( - - exp ) ! = - 1 )
    while ( exp - - > 0 )
    {
        value * = n ; // multiply n to itself exp times
    }
    printf ( " \ n \ n % d ^ % d = % l l d \ n \ n " , n , exp1 , value ) ;
    return 0;

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ; 
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ; 
	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ; 
	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ; 
	printf ( " % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;

Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ;

	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ;

	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

	printf ( "  % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
}
 Output: Enter Base: 5
Enter Power: 3
5 ^ 3 = 125

 Explanation The code above has an O (N) time complexity, where N is the exponent. O is the space complexity (1). Using While loop: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int main ( )
{
    int n , exp , exp1 ;
    long long int value = 1 ; 
    printf ( " enter the number and its exponential : \ n \ n " ) ;
    scanf ( " % d % d " , & n , & exp ) ; 
    exp1 = exp ;   // storing original value for future use
    // same as while ( ( - - exp ) ! = - 1 )
    while ( exp - - > 0 )
    {
        value * = n ; // multiply n to itself exp times
    }
    printf ( " \ n \ n % d ^ % d = % l l d \ n \ n " , n , exp1 , value ) ;
    return 0;
}
 Output: enter the number and its exponential :

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ; 
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ; 
	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ; 
	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ; 
	printf ( " % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
      return 0;
}

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ;

	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ; 
	printf ( " % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;

Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {

Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}

Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ;

	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ;

	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

	printf ( "  % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
}
 Output: Enter Base: 5
Enter Power: 3
5 ^ 3 = 125

 Explanation The code above has an O (N) time complexity, where N is the exponent. O is the space complexity (1). Using While loop: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int main ( )
{
    int n , exp , exp1 ;
    long long int value = 1 ; 
    printf ( " enter the number and its exponential : \ n \ n " ) ;
    scanf ( " % d % d " , & n , & exp ) ; 
    exp1 = exp ;   // storing original value for future use
    // same as while ( ( - - exp ) ! = - 1 )
    while ( exp - - > 0 )
    {
        value * = n ; // multiply n to itself exp times
    }
    printf ( " \ n \ n % d ^ % d = % l l d \ n \ n " , n , exp1 , value ) ;
    return 0;
}
 Output: enter the number and its exponential :

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ; 
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ; 
	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ; 
	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ; 
	printf ( " % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;

Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ;

	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ;

	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

	printf ( "  % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
}
 Output: Enter Base: 5
Enter Power: 3
5 ^ 3 = 125

 Explanation The code above has an O (N) time complexity, where N is the exponent. O is the space complexity (1). Using While loop: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int main ( )
{
    int n , exp , exp1 ;
    long long int value = 1 ; 
    printf ( " enter the number and its exponential : \ n \ n " ) ;
    scanf ( " % d % d " , & n , & exp ) ; 
    exp1 = exp ;   // storing original value for future use
    // same as while ( ( - - exp ) ! = - 1 )
    while ( exp - - > 0 )
    {
        value * = n ; // multiply n to itself exp times
    }
    printf ( " \ n \ n % d ^ % d = % l l d \ n \ n " , n , exp1 , value ) ;
    return 0;
}

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ; 
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ; 
	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ; 
	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ;

Now in this article we will going to understand with a help of a program how to calculate the power of a integer without using the function pow() in C. Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ;

	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ;

	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

	printf ( "  % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
}
 Output: Enter Base: 5
Enter Power: 3

Using for loop for Determining the Power of Given Integer Imagine you need to locate a ^ b. The easiest method is to multiply a by b times using a loop. Let a ^ b be the input. The base is a, while the exponent is b. Start with a power of 1. Using a loop, execute the following instructions b times power = power * a The power system has the final solution, a ^ b. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	int power = 1 , i ;
	for ( i = 1 ; i < = b ; + + i ) {
		power = power * a ;
	}
	return power ;
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ;

	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ;

	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ;

	printf ( "  % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
}
 Output: Enter Base: 5
Enter Power: 3
5 ^ 3 = 125

 Explanation The code above has an O (N) time complexity, where N is the exponent. O is the space complexity (1). Using While loop: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int main ( )
{
    int n , exp , exp1 ;
    long long int value = 1 ; 
    printf ( " enter the number and its exponential : \ n \ n " ) ;
    scanf ( " % d % d " , & n , & exp ) ; 
    exp1 = exp ;   // storing original value for future use
    // same as while ( ( - - exp ) ! = - 1 )
    while ( exp - - > 0 )
    {
        value * = n ; // multiply n to itself exp times
    }
    printf ( " \ n \ n % d ^ % d = % l l d \ n \ n " , n , exp1 , value ) ;
    return 0;
}

 Explanation Long Long Int is twice as large as Long Int. The format specifier for long long int is percent lld. Using Recursion to find the Power of Given Integer Assume that a ^ b is the input. The power of 'a' will increase by one with each recursive call. To obtain a ^ b, we call the recursive function b twice. Let Pow ( a, b ) be the recursive function used to calculate a ^ b. Simply return 1 if b == 0; else, return Pow (a, b -1) * a. Let's understand the above approach better with an example of a program in C: 
# include < stdio . h >
# include < string . h >
# include < conio . h >
# include < math >
# include < stdlib >
int Pow ( int a , int b ) {
	if ( b = = 0 )
		return 1 ;
	else
		return Pow ( a , b - 1 ) * X ; 
}
int main ( ) {
	long long int base , exponent ; 
	printf ( " enter Base : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & base ) ; 
	printf ( " enter Power : " ) ;
	scanf ( " % d " , & exponent ) ; 
	printf ( " % d ^ % d = % d " , base , exponent , Pow ( base , exponent ) ) ;
