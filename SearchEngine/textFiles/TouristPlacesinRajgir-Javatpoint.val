It was also the first capital of Magadha (now south Bihar) which was one of the strongest states in India during the rule of Mauryan Emperors and also had a part in the Mahabharata (believed to be one of the biggest battles in history), due to its king Jarasandha. This town is popular among tourists, due to its mesmerizing natural and historical beauty and different tourist places. The place also has its part in both Buddhism and Jainism, which makes it a perfect place for the learners of both religions as Mahaveera and Buddha taught their beliefs to the people. It has a forest monastery of Buddha which makes it one of the most important Buddhist preaching locations. You can also find the 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall in the Rajgir. The city consists of natural springs, towering hills, and also amazing landscapes which can win nature lovers' hearts. For lovers of history, you can also find Nalanda University on the Vicinity of the town (currently a contemporary university). To the people who are planning a trip to Bihar, Rajgir has everything which can make you fall in love with Bihar and its natural beauty.

It is created on the hill of Ratnagiri (much more popular than Griddhakuta) and is one of the seven Peace Pagodas (Shanti Stupas in Hindi) and also one of the most popular tourist places in Rajgir. Due to being situated at an altitude of 400 meters, it is also the highest pagoda in the world and is popular as the symbol of cooperation and peace. The stupa was planned by the Nipponzan Myohoji first, and in 1969, a Japanese monk Fujii Guruji created it. It is really beautiful by the look and is created with white marble and four statues of Buddha (created by pure gold showing four stages of his life, birth, enlightenment, preaching, and death). There is also a temple named "Nipponzan Myohoji" nearby the stupa. Another interesting fact about visiting this Stupa is that you can also visit the Griddhakuta and Ashoka Stupa, which have their place in history and beauty to have a look. Also, to reach the Vishwashanti stupa, you have to take a Ropeway which can only take one person at a time and is nearly 2200 feet long. This ropeway was created by the Fujii Guruji to represent the friendship between Japan and India and is being maintained by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation. And by this ropeway, you can enjoy the beauty of the Rajgir Town full of greenery and nature but to those who don't want to go through them can use the Serpentine Staircase (which is not an easy way either) Timing: 9 AM to 5.30 PM 2. Rajgir Glass bridge A stunning glass bridge is increasing the beauty of Rajgir and it is a must visit place if you are in the city. It is just 10 km away from the Rajgir Railway Station and 6 Km away from the Rajgir Wildlife Safari. The main purpose behind the construction of the bridge is to give a viweing platform to the place. The Bridge is located inside the Nature Safari Park, and no one should ever miss it during the tour to Rajgir.

It was also the first capital of Magadha (now south Bihar) which was one of the strongest states in India during the rule of Mauryan Emperors and also had a part in the Mahabharata (believed to be one of the biggest battles in history), due to its king Jarasandha. This town is popular among tourists, due to its mesmerizing natural and historical beauty and different tourist places. The place also has its part in both Buddhism and Jainism, which makes it a perfect place for the learners of both religions as Mahaveera and Buddha taught their beliefs to the people. It has a forest monastery of Buddha which makes it one of the most important Buddhist preaching locations. You can also find the 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall in the Rajgir. The city consists of natural springs, towering hills, and also amazing landscapes which can win nature lovers' hearts. For lovers of history, you can also find Nalanda University on the Vicinity of the town (currently a contemporary university). To the people who are planning a trip to Bihar, Rajgir has everything which can make you fall in love with Bihar and its natural beauty.

It is created on the hill of Ratnagiri (much more popular than Griddhakuta) and is one of the seven Peace Pagodas (Shanti Stupas in Hindi) and also one of the most popular tourist places in Rajgir. Due to being situated at an altitude of 400 meters, it is also the highest pagoda in the world and is popular as the symbol of cooperation and peace. The stupa was planned by the Nipponzan Myohoji first, and in 1969, a Japanese monk Fujii Guruji created it. It is really beautiful by the look and is created with white marble and four statues of Buddha (created by pure gold showing four stages of his life, birth, enlightenment, preaching, and death). There is also a temple named "Nipponzan Myohoji" nearby the stupa. Another interesting fact about visiting this Stupa is that you can also visit the Griddhakuta and Ashoka Stupa, which have their place in history and beauty to have a look. Also, to reach the Vishwashanti stupa, you have to take a Ropeway which can only take one person at a time and is nearly 2200 feet long. This ropeway was created by the Fujii Guruji to represent the friendship between Japan and India and is being maintained by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation.

It was also the first capital of Magadha (now south Bihar) which was one of the strongest states in India during the rule of Mauryan Emperors and also had a part in the Mahabharata (believed to be one of the biggest battles in history), due to its king Jarasandha. This town is popular among tourists, due to its mesmerizing natural and historical beauty and different tourist places. The place also has its part in both Buddhism and Jainism, which makes it a perfect place for the learners of both religions as Mahaveera and Buddha taught their beliefs to the people. It has a forest monastery of Buddha which makes it one of the most important Buddhist preaching locations. You can also find the 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall in the Rajgir. The city consists of natural springs, towering hills, and also amazing landscapes which can win nature lovers' hearts. For lovers of history, you can also find Nalanda University on the Vicinity of the town (currently a contemporary university). To the people who are planning a trip to Bihar, Rajgir has everything which can make you fall in love with Bihar and its natural beauty. If you are wondering about a few main areas not to miss while visiting the Rajgir, here is the list. 1. Vishwa Shanti Stupa Vishwa Shanti Stupa or also known as Japanese Stupa, is 8 km away from the Railway station of Rajgir. It is created on the hill of Ratnagiri (much more popular than Griddhakuta) and is one of the seven Peace Pagodas (Shanti Stupas in Hindi) and also one of the most popular tourist places in Rajgir. Due to being situated at an altitude of 400 meters, it is also the highest pagoda in the world and is popular as the symbol of cooperation and peace. The stupa was planned by the Nipponzan Myohoji first, and in 1969, a Japanese monk Fujii Guruji created it. It is really beautiful by the look and is created with white marble and four statues of Buddha (created by pure gold showing four stages of his life, birth, enlightenment, preaching, and death). There is also a temple named "Nipponzan Myohoji" nearby the stupa. Another interesting fact about visiting this Stupa is that you can also visit the Griddhakuta and Ashoka Stupa, which have their place in history and beauty to have a look. Also, to reach the Vishwashanti stupa, you have to take a Ropeway which can only take one person at a time and is nearly 2200 feet long. This ropeway was created by the Fujii Guruji to represent the friendship between Japan and India and is being maintained by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation. And by this ropeway, you can enjoy the beauty of the Rajgir Town full of greenery and nature but to those who don't want to go through them can use the Serpentine Staircase (which is not an easy way either) Timing: 9 AM to 5.30 PM 2.

It was also the first capital of Magadha (now south Bihar) which was one of the strongest states in India during the rule of Mauryan Emperors and also had a part in the Mahabharata (believed to be one of the biggest battles in history), due to its king Jarasandha. This town is popular among tourists, due to its mesmerizing natural and historical beauty and different tourist places. The place also has its part in both Buddhism and Jainism, which makes it a perfect place for the learners of both religions as Mahaveera and Buddha taught their beliefs to the people. It has a forest monastery of Buddha which makes it one of the most important Buddhist preaching locations. You can also find the 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall in the Rajgir. The city consists of natural springs, towering hills, and also amazing landscapes which can win nature lovers' hearts. For lovers of history, you can also find Nalanda University on the Vicinity of the town (currently a contemporary university). To the people who are planning a trip to Bihar, Rajgir has everything which can make you fall in love with Bihar and its natural beauty. If you are wondering about a few main areas not to miss while visiting the Rajgir, here is the list. 1. Vishwa Shanti Stupa Vishwa Shanti Stupa or also known as Japanese Stupa, is 8 km away from the Railway station of Rajgir. It is created on the hill of Ratnagiri (much more popular than Griddhakuta) and is one of the seven Peace Pagodas (Shanti Stupas in Hindi) and also one of the most popular tourist places in Rajgir. Due to being situated at an altitude of 400 meters, it is also the highest pagoda in the world and is popular as the symbol of cooperation and peace. The stupa was planned by the Nipponzan Myohoji first, and in 1969, a Japanese monk Fujii Guruji created it. It is really beautiful by the look and is created with white marble and four statues of Buddha (created by pure gold showing four stages of his life, birth, enlightenment, preaching, and death). There is also a temple named "Nipponzan Myohoji" nearby the stupa. Another interesting fact about visiting this Stupa is that you can also visit the Griddhakuta and Ashoka Stupa, which have their place in history and beauty to have a look. Also, to reach the Vishwashanti stupa, you have to take a Ropeway which can only take one person at a time and is nearly 2200 feet long. This ropeway was created by the Fujii Guruji to represent the friendship between Japan and India and is being maintained by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation. And by this ropeway, you can enjoy the beauty of the Rajgir Town full of greenery and nature but to those who don't want to go through them can use the Serpentine Staircase (which is not an easy way either) Timing: 9 AM to 5.30 PM 2. Rajgir Glass bridge A stunning glass bridge is increasing the beauty of Rajgir and it is a must visit place if you are in the city. It is just 10 km away from the Rajgir Railway Station and 6 Km away from the Rajgir Wildlife Safari. The main purpose behind the construction of the bridge is to give a viweing platform to the place. The Bridge is located inside the Nature Safari Park, and no one should ever miss it during the tour to Rajgir. This beautiful glass bridge has a distinct contribution to the beauty of Bihar and has the same look as the Glass Bridge created in the Hangzhou Province in China. This glass bridge is made up of 3, 15 mm glasses which is an 85 feet long and 6 feet wide bridge and can handle nearby 40 visitors at a time with complete security, but as security is the first priority, only 15 to 20 people can visit the glass bridge at one time.This bridge is the center of attraction for all national and international tourists and a must-visit part of the Rajgir Trip. Timing: 9 AM - 5 PM (not open on Monday) 3. Rajgir Wildlife Safari Just 4 km Away from the Railway station, the Rajgiri Zoo Safariis one of the most beautiful places there.

It was created in the year 2017 by order of Chief Minister Mr. Nitish Kumar and, in 2022, got permission to let nearby 1000 visitors come in daily.The Foundation of Zoo Safari wasn't easy at all. Still, with the contribution of the various departments (such as Environment, Forest, and climate change) of the Bihar state government, it was completed at the cost of 177 Crore Indian Rupees. Now it has various animals, tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, and many other animals, and is divided into five different and massive zones. There is also a butterfly park, an interpretation center, a gallery for orientation, and an amphitheater in the park. It also offers a management section for proper care at the park.

It was also the first capital of Magadha (now south Bihar) which was one of the strongest states in India during the rule of Mauryan Emperors and also had a part in the Mahabharata (believed to be one of the biggest battles in history), due to its king Jarasandha. This town is popular among tourists, due to its mesmerizing natural and historical beauty and different tourist places. The place also has its part in both Buddhism and Jainism, which makes it a perfect place for the learners of both religions as Mahaveera and Buddha taught their beliefs to the people. It has a forest monastery of Buddha which makes it one of the most important Buddhist preaching locations. You can also find the 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall in the Rajgir. The city consists of natural springs, towering hills, and also amazing landscapes which can win nature lovers' hearts. For lovers of history, you can also find Nalanda University on the Vicinity of the town (currently a contemporary university). To the people who are planning a trip to Bihar, Rajgir has everything which can make you fall in love with Bihar and its natural beauty. If you are wondering about a few main areas not to miss while visiting the Rajgir, here is the list. 1. Vishwa Shanti Stupa Vishwa Shanti Stupa or also known as Japanese Stupa, is 8 km away from the Railway station of Rajgir. It is created on the hill of Ratnagiri (much more popular than Griddhakuta) and is one of the seven Peace Pagodas (Shanti Stupas in Hindi) and also one of the most popular tourist places in Rajgir. Due to being situated at an altitude of 400 meters, it is also the highest pagoda in the world and is popular as the symbol of cooperation and peace. The stupa was planned by the Nipponzan Myohoji first, and in 1969, a Japanese monk Fujii Guruji created it. It is really beautiful by the look and is created with white marble and four statues of Buddha (created by pure gold showing four stages of his life, birth, enlightenment, preaching, and death). There is also a temple named "Nipponzan Myohoji" nearby the stupa. Another interesting fact about visiting this Stupa is that you can also visit the Griddhakuta and Ashoka Stupa, which have their place in history and beauty to have a look. Also, to reach the Vishwashanti stupa, you have to take a Ropeway which can only take one person at a time and is nearly 2200 feet long. This ropeway was created by the Fujii Guruji to represent the friendship between Japan and India and is being maintained by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation. And by this ropeway, you can enjoy the beauty of the Rajgir Town full of greenery and nature but to those who don't want to go through them can use the Serpentine Staircase (which is not an easy way either) Timing: 9 AM to 5.30 PM 2. Rajgir Glass bridge A stunning glass bridge is increasing the beauty of Rajgir and it is a must visit place if you are in the city. It is just 10 km away from the Rajgir Railway Station and 6 Km away from the Rajgir Wildlife Safari. The main purpose behind the construction of the bridge is to give a viweing platform to the place. The Bridge is located inside the Nature Safari Park, and no one should ever miss it during the tour to Rajgir. This beautiful glass bridge has a distinct contribution to the beauty of Bihar and has the same look as the Glass Bridge created in the Hangzhou Province in China. This glass bridge is made up of 3, 15 mm glasses which is an 85 feet long and 6 feet wide bridge and can handle nearby 40 visitors at a time with complete security, but as security is the first priority, only 15 to 20 people can visit the glass bridge at one time.This bridge is the center of attraction for all national and international tourists and a must-visit part of the Rajgir Trip. Timing: 9 AM - 5 PM (not open on Monday) 3. Rajgir Wildlife Safari Just 4 km Away from the Railway station, the Rajgiri Zoo Safariis one of the most beautiful places there.

It was created in the year 2017 by order of Chief Minister Mr. Nitish Kumar and, in 2022, got permission to let nearby 1000 visitors come in daily.The Foundation of Zoo Safari wasn't easy at all. Still, with the contribution of the various departments (such as Environment, Forest, and climate change) of the Bihar state government, it was completed at the cost of 177 Crore Indian Rupees. Now it has various animals, tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, and many other animals, and is divided into five different and massive zones. There is also a butterfly park, an interpretation center, a gallery for orientation, and an amphitheater in the park. It also offers a management section for proper care at the park.

In the time of the Buddhist period, it was also used as a Yagna site. Maniyar Math is an absolutely incredible Gupta-period workpiece made of cylindrical bricks.

It was historically located near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir) and about 90 kilometers (56 mi) southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna), operating from 427 to 1197 CE, also recognized in the era of scholars as the "Golden Age of India."
