Men: Days Now, Men and Days are inversely proportional to each other. If we increase the number of men fewer days will be required to complete the work. Inversely proportional means i.e., 5: 15 = 28: x Or, x = (28*15)/ 5 Or, x = 84 days Hence, 5 men can reap a field in 84 days.

What is the banker's discount? Rs. 210 Rs. 212 Rs. 216 Rs. 218 Show Answer Workspace Answer: C Explanation: Face value = Rs. 2700 TD = Rs. 200 PW (present worth) = FV (face value) - TD (true discount) = 2700 ? 200 = Rs. 2500 True discount is the simple interest on the present value for the unexpired time. Now, simple interest on Rs. 2500 for unexpired time = Rs. 200 The rate of simple interest Banker's discount is the simple interest on the face value of the bill for unexpired time, i.e., simple interest on Rs. 2700 for unexpired time or remaining time. R = 8% Banker's discount Aptitude True Discount and Banker's Discount Test Paper 1 Aptitude True Discount and Banker's Discount Test Paper 2 Aptitude True Discount and Banker's Discount Test Paper 3 True Discount and Banker's Discount Concepts 30) Logarithm Aptitude 1) Find the logarithm of 1/256 to the base 2?2. 16 13/5 -16/3 12 Show Answer Workspace Answer: C Explanation: Let log2?2 [1/256] = x We know that loga y = x is similar to ax = y So, we can write it as [1/256] = (2?2) x Or, (2?2) x = [1/28] Or, [21 * 21/2]x = 1/28 Or, 23x/2 = 2-8 Therefore, 3x/2 = -8 Hence, x = (-8 * 2)/ 3 = -16/3 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 1 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 2 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 3 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 4 Logarithm Concepts 31) Square Roots and Cube Roots Aptitude 1) = 80 3.74 149.67 196 225 Show Answer Workspace Answer: C Explanation: = 80 ? ?=142= 14 × 14 = 196 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 1 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 2 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 3 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 4 Square Roots and Cube Roots Concepts 32) Problems on Numbers Aptitude 1) If 30% of a certain number is 12.6, what is the number? 24 42 23 32 Show Answer Workspace Answer: B Explanation: Let the required number be x.

Men: Days Now, Men and Days are inversely proportional to each other. If we increase the number of men fewer days will be required to complete the work. Inversely proportional means i.e., 5: 15 = 28: x Or, x = (28*15)/ 5 Or, x = 84 days Hence, 5 men can reap a field in 84 days.

What is the banker's discount? Rs. 210 Rs. 212 Rs. 216 Rs. 218 Show Answer Workspace Answer: C Explanation: Face value = Rs. 2700 TD = Rs. 200 PW (present worth) = FV (face value) - TD (true discount) = 2700 ? 200 = Rs. 2500 True discount is the simple interest on the present value for the unexpired time. Now, simple interest on Rs. 2500 for unexpired time = Rs. 200 The rate of simple interest Banker's discount is the simple interest on the face value of the bill for unexpired time, i.e., simple interest on Rs. 2700 for unexpired time or remaining time. R = 8% Banker's discount Aptitude True Discount and Banker's Discount Test Paper 1 Aptitude True Discount and Banker's Discount Test Paper 2 Aptitude True Discount and Banker's Discount Test Paper 3 True Discount and Banker's Discount Concepts 30) Logarithm Aptitude 1) Find the logarithm of 1/256 to the base 2?2. 16 13/5 -16/3 12 Show Answer Workspace Answer: C Explanation: Let log2?2 [1/256] = x We know that loga y = x is similar to ax = y So, we can write it as [1/256] = (2?2) x Or, (2?2) x = [1/28] Or, [21 * 21/2]x = 1/28 Or, 23x/2 = 2-8 Therefore, 3x/2 = -8 Hence, x = (-8 * 2)/ 3 = -16/3 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 1 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 2 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 3 Aptitude Logarithm Test Paper 4 Logarithm Concepts 31) Square Roots and Cube Roots Aptitude 1) = 80 3.74 149.67 196 225 Show Answer Workspace Answer: C Explanation: = 80 ? ?=142= 14 × 14 = 196 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 1 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 2 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 3 Aptitude Square Roots and Cube Roots Test Paper 4 Square Roots and Cube Roots Concepts 32) Problems on Numbers Aptitude 1) If 30% of a certain number is 12.6, what is the number? 24 42 23 32 Show Answer Workspace Answer: B Explanation: Let the required number be x.
