In the sport of cricket, which is played on a 22-yard pitch, it serves as a technical aid. Cricket watchers and supporters can now comprehend the technical aspects of the game thanks to the usage of the decision review system. In the last ten years, match outcomes have been significantly influenced by the decision review system. In all versions of cricket, the legality of the rules governing the decision review mechanism has always been disputed. Television replays, technology that follows a ball's route and predicts what it will do, microphones to pick up minute sounds created when a ball strikes a bat or a pad, and infrared imaging to pick up temperature changes when a ball strikes a bat or a pad are the key tools that have been employed. History Of Decision Review System (DRS) Senaka Weeraratna's idea of player-referral served as the foundation for the DRS system (Sri Lankan lawyer). In a letter that appeared in the national newspaper "Australian" on March 25, 1997, he was the first to advocate for a player referral system for cricket. Prior to March 25, 1997, there was no such system or process in place, not even in other sports, until he made the public aware of the advantages of such a player recommendation system. The decision review system was first used in a test match between India and Sri Lanka in July 2008. A decision review system is a technology-based technique that supports and is utilised by the on-field umpires to help them make choices for cricket decisions like outs. At the conclusion of each event on the ground, the decision review system makes sure that decisions are made in the most transparent manner possible and that the correct choice was made. When a team chooses the decision review system, the on-field umpire will use the decision review system technology to consult with the third umpire to determine the best and most accurate call for that specific occurrence. During the first test match between Pakistan and New Zealand in Dunedin in November 2009, the International Cricket Council formally introduced the decision review system. In order to properly account for all the rules involved in the DRS call made by the team, the DRS system and its rules have undergone numerous adjustments. Rules Regarding Decision Review System (DRS) A few fixed procedures that the third umpire must follow as part of the decision review system guidelines established for the game of cricket are among the decisions that are reviewed through the system. After the on-field umpire has made their judgement and the challenging side has been given 15 seconds to decide whether or not to go for the DRS call, they may do so. The on-field umpire must get a T signal from the fielding team captain or the batter who was ruled out in that round before they can appeal the decision. The third umpire determines if the delivery was lawful when the captain or batsman gives the T sign to rule on whether the bowler overstepped before starting the replays at the other end. If the bowler delivered the ball in a fair and lawful manner, the third umpire moves on to the end where the action took place, which was the focal point. The third umpire uses the terms "ultra-edge" or "real-time snigger" and "hotspot" to refer to two indicators that the batsman's bat has been struck by the bass. If there is an LBW or a catch appeal, it happens in certain situations. Therein, the process of heat created by the interaction between the ball and the bat, which will result in a spot on the bat in case of a possible edge, is done using the Hotspot technology. When the ball is close to the bat, however, the Ultra Edge or RTS technology employs sound to detect a deviation or spike. Final Decision The third umpire then analyses multiple TV replays from various perspectives, comes to a decision, and then communicates that decision to the on-field umpire, stating whether their analysis concurs with the first judgement, disputes the call, or is inconclusive. The on-field umpire then makes the ultimate decision, either by re-signalling a call that is standing or cancelling a call that is being overturned before issuing the corrected signal. Only blatantly inaccurate calls are overturned; if the Third Umpire's investigation falls within predetermined margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, the on-field umpire's initial ruling remains.

In the sport of cricket, which is played on a 22-yard pitch, it serves as a technical aid. Cricket watchers and supporters can now comprehend the technical aspects of the game thanks to the usage of the decision review system. In the last ten years, match outcomes have been significantly influenced by the decision review system. In all versions of cricket, the legality of the rules governing the decision review mechanism has always been disputed. Television replays, technology that follows a ball's route and predicts what it will do, microphones to pick up minute sounds created when a ball strikes a bat or a pad, and infrared imaging to pick up temperature changes when a ball strikes a bat or a pad are the key tools that have been employed. History Of Decision Review System (DRS) Senaka Weeraratna's idea of player-referral served as the foundation for the DRS system (Sri Lankan lawyer). In a letter that appeared in the national newspaper "Australian" on March 25, 1997, he was the first to advocate for a player referral system for cricket. Prior to March 25, 1997, there was no such system or process in place, not even in other sports, until he made the public aware of the advantages of such a player recommendation system. The decision review system was first used in a test match between India and Sri Lanka in July 2008. A decision review system is a technology-based technique that supports and is utilised by the on-field umpires to help them make choices for cricket decisions like outs. At the conclusion of each event on the ground, the decision review system makes sure that decisions are made in the most transparent manner possible and that the correct choice was made. When a team chooses the decision review system, the on-field umpire will use the decision review system technology to consult with the third umpire to determine the best and most accurate call for that specific occurrence. During the first test match between Pakistan and New Zealand in Dunedin in November 2009, the International Cricket Council formally introduced the decision review system. In order to properly account for all the rules involved in the DRS call made by the team, the DRS system and its rules have undergone numerous adjustments. Rules Regarding Decision Review System (DRS) A few fixed procedures that the third umpire must follow as part of the decision review system guidelines established for the game of cricket are among the decisions that are reviewed through the system. After the on-field umpire has made their judgement and the challenging side has been given 15 seconds to decide whether or not to go for the DRS call, they may do so. The on-field umpire must get a T signal from the fielding team captain or the batter who was ruled out in that round before they can appeal the decision. The third umpire determines if the delivery was lawful when the captain or batsman gives the T sign to rule on whether the bowler overstepped before starting the replays at the other end. If the bowler delivered the ball in a fair and lawful manner, the third umpire moves on to the end where the action took place, which was the focal point. The third umpire uses the terms "ultra-edge" or "real-time snigger" and "hotspot" to refer to two indicators that the batsman's bat has been struck by the bass. If there is an LBW or a catch appeal, it happens in certain situations. Therein, the process of heat created by the interaction between the ball and the bat, which will result in a spot on the bat in case of a possible edge, is done using the Hotspot technology. When the ball is close to the bat, however, the Ultra Edge or RTS technology employs sound to detect a deviation or spike. Final Decision The third umpire then analyses multiple TV replays from various perspectives, comes to a decision, and then communicates that decision to the on-field umpire, stating whether their analysis concurs with the first judgement, disputes the call, or is inconclusive. The on-field umpire then makes the ultimate decision, either by re-signalling a call that is standing or cancelling a call that is being overturned before issuing the corrected signal. Only blatantly inaccurate calls are overturned; if the Third Umpire's investigation falls within predetermined margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, the on-field umpire's initial ruling remains.

In the sport of cricket, which is played on a 22-yard pitch, it serves as a technical aid. Cricket watchers and supporters can now comprehend the technical aspects of the game thanks to the usage of the decision review system. In the last ten years, match outcomes have been significantly influenced by the decision review system. In all versions of cricket, the legality of the rules governing the decision review mechanism has always been disputed. Television replays, technology that follows a ball's route and predicts what it will do, microphones to pick up minute sounds created when a ball strikes a bat or a pad, and infrared imaging to pick up temperature changes when a ball strikes a bat or a pad are the key tools that have been employed. History Of Decision Review System (DRS) Senaka Weeraratna's idea of player-referral served as the foundation for the DRS system (Sri Lankan lawyer). In a letter that appeared in the national newspaper "Australian" on March 25, 1997, he was the first to advocate for a player referral system for cricket. Prior to March 25, 1997, there was no such system or process in place, not even in other sports, until he made the public aware of the advantages of such a player recommendation system. The decision review system was first used in a test match between India and Sri Lanka in July 2008. A decision review system is a technology-based technique that supports and is utilised by the on-field umpires to help them make choices for cricket decisions like outs. At the conclusion of each event on the ground, the decision review system makes sure that decisions are made in the most transparent manner possible and that the correct choice was made. When a team chooses the decision review system, the on-field umpire will use the decision review system technology to consult with the third umpire to determine the best and most accurate call for that specific occurrence. During the first test match between Pakistan and New Zealand in Dunedin in November 2009, the International Cricket Council formally introduced the decision review system. In order to properly account for all the rules involved in the DRS call made by the team, the DRS system and its rules have undergone numerous adjustments. Rules Regarding Decision Review System (DRS) A few fixed procedures that the third umpire must follow as part of the decision review system guidelines established for the game of cricket are among the decisions that are reviewed through the system. After the on-field umpire has made their judgement and the challenging side has been given 15 seconds to decide whether or not to go for the DRS call, they may do so. The on-field umpire must get a T signal from the fielding team captain or the batter who was ruled out in that round before they can appeal the decision. The third umpire determines if the delivery was lawful when the captain or batsman gives the T sign to rule on whether the bowler overstepped before starting the replays at the other end. If the bowler delivered the ball in a fair and lawful manner, the third umpire moves on to the end where the action took place, which was the focal point. The third umpire uses the terms "ultra-edge" or "real-time snigger" and "hotspot" to refer to two indicators that the batsman's bat has been struck by the bass. If there is an LBW or a catch appeal, it happens in certain situations. Therein, the process of heat created by the interaction between the ball and the bat, which will result in a spot on the bat in case of a possible edge, is done using the Hotspot technology. When the ball is close to the bat, however, the Ultra Edge or RTS technology employs sound to detect a deviation or spike. Final Decision The third umpire then analyses multiple TV replays from various perspectives, comes to a decision, and then communicates that decision to the on-field umpire, stating whether their analysis concurs with the first judgement, disputes the call, or is inconclusive. The on-field umpire then makes the ultimate decision, either by re-signalling a call that is standing or cancelling a call that is being overturned before issuing the corrected signal. Only blatantly inaccurate calls are overturned; if the Third Umpire's investigation falls within predetermined margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, the on-field umpire's initial ruling remains.

In the sport of cricket, which is played on a 22-yard pitch, it serves as a technical aid. Cricket watchers and supporters can now comprehend the technical aspects of the game thanks to the usage of the decision review system. In the last ten years, match outcomes have been significantly influenced by the decision review system. In all versions of cricket, the legality of the rules governing the decision review mechanism has always been disputed. Television replays, technology that follows a ball's route and predicts what it will do, microphones to pick up minute sounds created when a ball strikes a bat or a pad, and infrared imaging to pick up temperature changes when a ball strikes a bat or a pad are the key tools that have been employed. History Of Decision Review System (DRS) Senaka Weeraratna's idea of player-referral served as the foundation for the DRS system (Sri Lankan lawyer). In a letter that appeared in the national newspaper "Australian" on March 25, 1997, he was the first to advocate for a player referral system for cricket. Prior to March 25, 1997, there was no such system or process in place, not even in other sports, until he made the public aware of the advantages of such a player recommendation system. The decision review system was first used in a test match between India and Sri Lanka in July 2008. A decision review system is a technology-based technique that supports and is utilised by the on-field umpires to help them make choices for cricket decisions like outs. At the conclusion of each event on the ground, the decision review system makes sure that decisions are made in the most transparent manner possible and that the correct choice was made. When a team chooses the decision review system, the on-field umpire will use the decision review system technology to consult with the third umpire to determine the best and most accurate call for that specific occurrence. During the first test match between Pakistan and New Zealand in Dunedin in November 2009, the International Cricket Council formally introduced the decision review system. In order to properly account for all the rules involved in the DRS call made by the team, the DRS system and its rules have undergone numerous adjustments. Rules Regarding Decision Review System (DRS) A few fixed procedures that the third umpire must follow as part of the decision review system guidelines established for the game of cricket are among the decisions that are reviewed through the system. After the on-field umpire has made their judgement and the challenging side has been given 15 seconds to decide whether or not to go for the DRS call, they may do so. The on-field umpire must get a T signal from the fielding team captain or the batter who was ruled out in that round before they can appeal the decision. The third umpire determines if the delivery was lawful when the captain or batsman gives the T sign to rule on whether the bowler overstepped before starting the replays at the other end. If the bowler delivered the ball in a fair and lawful manner, the third umpire moves on to the end where the action took place, which was the focal point. The third umpire uses the terms "ultra-edge" or "real-time snigger" and "hotspot" to refer to two indicators that the batsman's bat has been struck by the bass. If there is an LBW or a catch appeal, it happens in certain situations. Therein, the process of heat created by the interaction between the ball and the bat, which will result in a spot on the bat in case of a possible edge, is done using the Hotspot technology. When the ball is close to the bat, however, the Ultra Edge or RTS technology employs sound to detect a deviation or spike. Final Decision The third umpire then analyses multiple TV replays from various perspectives, comes to a decision, and then communicates that decision to the on-field umpire, stating whether their analysis concurs with the first judgement, disputes the call, or is inconclusive. The on-field umpire then makes the ultimate decision, either by re-signalling a call that is standing or cancelling a call that is being overturned before issuing the corrected signal. Only blatantly inaccurate calls are overturned; if the Third Umpire's investigation falls within predetermined margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, the on-field umpire's initial ruling remains.
