Eijaz and Pavitra discussed their differences in faith and age in an interview this year with a channel. Eijaz said that people are looking down on them because he is 46 and she is nearly 14 years younger than him, but they will sort it out. He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them. The fact that she has a very mature man who is 14 years older than her and peaceful makes this a win-win situation for her, Pavitra said in the same interview.

Nothing has changed from my side. In a media platform conversation, Pavitra Punia responded to Sumit Maheshwari's assertions regarding their marriage and made it clear that she would expose all at the appropriate times. She'd stated, "I'll have an answer shortly, I promise. In all actuality, it doesn't matter that much to me. All I would say is that it's okay to surf another's wave of fame. I don't have any remarks to make at the moment, but I will soon."

She obliged when I questioned her, and then I found out one-by-one stunning truths from her. I don't really want to speak at this moment. It's possible that I'm tense right now, but only time will tell, and it will become apparent when she joins Big Boss probably isn't good if I speak, as that might work against her."

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.

He acknowledged that sometimes they do feel horrible, but he also said that insults or stupidity are like gifts given to him, and they shouldn't bother him if he isn't accepting them.
